## Farewell Peter! 

Sadly early next week [Peter][Peter] will be finishing up his internship with us in preparation to return to University and complete the final year of his degree. He has been a great sport and such a valuable asset to the team. We want to say thank you for all of your hard work. Peters work ethic has been nothing but excellent and we will most definitely miss his fun, hardworking and can do attitude. We want to wish you all the luck in the world with your final year, but as always we know you will do amazing.
