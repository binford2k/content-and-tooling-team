title: "2022-07-22: Content & Tooling Team Status Update"
---

It has been another quiet week for the team with most people out at some point. This week I made my first trip to our office in Belfast after returning from maternity leave. It was great to see familiar faces and catch up with lots of fancy coffee.

As always, thank you for all your contributions we really appreciate your time and effort. 

Enjoy your weekend!

## Deferring Functions

The latest piece we have been working on with some of our colleagues in Portland is *deferred functions*. Thanks to [tvpartytonight][tvpartytonight] and [binford2k][binford2k] a working example can be seen in our [puppetlabs-postgresql][puppetlabs-postgresql] module. 

Check out [Ben's blog post](https://dev.to/puppet/updating-puppet-modules-for-deferred-functions-5d6k) for more information on this.
