Happy Thanksgiving to everyone celebrating.

Now that we are into late November, my calendar has started to fill with festive outings and I am sure everyone is probably in a similar sitation. 
As the days pass I am seeing more and more Decorations appear around the area I live in, although I am trying to refrain until it is officially December.

## We love our metrics

## Codebase Hardening
We are coming to a close on our codebase hardening effort and have rolled out some great changes to some of our supported modules. 
A combination of [Lukas](https://github.com/LukasAud) and [David](https://github.com/david22swan) have been working on this for a number of weeks and we are delighted that we are very near the end. 

## PDK User Survey
[Gavin](https://github.com/GSPatton) is currently working on gathering user information to map out our next steps for the PDK. If you have some feedback or input please keep an eye out for the survey! We will communicate when it is ready to go. All feedback no matter how big or small would really be appreciated.
