Happy Friday everyone! Back with another blog post, and as we here in the CAT team begin to wind down and look back on the work completed this week, we have lots to smile about!ðŸ˜Š

## PDK 2.6.0 ReleaseðŸŽ‰!!

There was some big news this week with the long awaited release of PDK 2.6.0, which was thanks to the huge effort and hours put in by [Craig][craig] and [Gavin][gavin]. This release includes upgrades to pdk-templates, support for Fedora 36 and some bug fixes. We are thrilled to get this over the line as I'm sure you all are too.

## Certified Kubernetes

Another big announcement - earlier this week we received word that the [puppetlabs-kubernetes](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes) module had officially renewed its Kubernetes (v1.26) certification for another year.

## Come meet us at CfgMgmtCamp

Just another friendly reminder to come and say hello to [Craig][craig], [Gavin][gavin] and [David][david] if you're attending CfgMgmtCamp.
