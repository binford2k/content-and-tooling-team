## I love that Friday feeling!

It's been another quiet week while we work on replacing cogs and putting out fires behind the scenes.
It feels like weeks are getting shorter as the holiday season starts hitting us.

As mentioned on a previous [`post`][post], this week we have decided to offically announce the retirement of several modules from our supported list.
This is done in an effort to focus our resources on the areas that matter the most.
We have also been discussing about the future of some of our internal tools, such as PRM, which might need a refactor soon enough.

As usual, we'd like to thanks all community members for your contributions and let y'all know that they are very much appreciated.

And that's all for now. Enjoy your weekend, folks!
