## It's Friday!

What a week! The CAT team have been super busy this week.

At the close of Community Day on Monday we had cut 10 new module releases.
Many of the modules hadn't seen a release since 2021.
I'm hoping to be able to keep this cadence up so that content available on the forge is always nice and fresh âœ¨. 

A while back we introduced a "stale" bot ðŸ¤–. The aim of the bot was to help us keep on top of the vast amount of issues and pull requests we were seeing.
Being a small team means that staying organised is important and the first version of the bot helped us get back up and running.

When the bot started to do it's thing, we received some really good feedback from you and we learnt alot about how the bot was being perceived.
In the spirit of learning and iteration, Lukas has tweaked how the bot will work in the future and once again will observe how useful it is for us and you.

The main changes include a change of wording and how we label issues and pull requests that don't meet the time constraints we've configured.
Additionally we will no longer be auto-closing issues. They will just get labeled so we can pick them up in our filters and give them the attention that they deserve.

In other news, as part of our effords to increase the overall level of quality for our modules, David has begun an effort to better enforce the various syntax standards
that have been driven by the community.

For me the highlight of this week was the successful return of Community Day.
It's refreshing spending time with our amazing community and I'm excited to have the opportunity to do it more often.

Have a great weekend!
