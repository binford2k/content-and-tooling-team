## Wooooo Friday!

There we go! Another week done. And... January (the longest month of the year) is almost over. There are many reasons to rejoice. Here are our updates for the week.

## New Community Days

Usually, we have held our community days on Mondays. Now we're trialling holding them on Fridays to suit all team members availability.

## PDK 2.6.1

We're starting to get the hang of this! [Craig](craig) and [me](gavin) have started to take more ownership of PDK and have been doing some deep dives in this extensive tool. This latest release adds support for OSX 12 and Ubuntu 22.04.

## David's blog post

And finally, if you haven't already seen it, check out [David](david)'s blog post on how he removed puppet-module-gems from our supported modules. You can find it [here](https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/posts/2023-01-10-remove-puppet-module-gems/).
