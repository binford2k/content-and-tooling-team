## CI Improvements

Hacktoberfest is an annual event hosted by DigitalOcean and DEV.to in order to promote Open Source collaboration. More details can be found [here][hacktoberfest]. 
It was held on 20-Oct-2020 and we did a demo on Trusted Contributor CI project where public (test-)pull request run unit and acceptance tests on entirely public infrastructure and report the [results in public](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-testing/pull/306/checks). 
Thanks to [David][DavidS], [Dany][carabasdaniel] and [Michael][michaeltlombardi] for the demo. 

As part of that work, we submitted some work and bug report to upstream repos:
- Fix fallback filename when using a subdirectory: [GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community#456](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/pull/456)
  
Expect more detailed blog posts and announcements as we continue to progress towards a production-ready stable service.
