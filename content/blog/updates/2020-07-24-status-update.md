title: '24th July 2020: IAC Team Status Update'
---

It's Friday - time for another status update from the IAC Team!
Here's a short overview of some of the work we and the community have been up to recently:

## Community Contributions
We've had plenty of great community contributions this week:

- [fe80][fe80] [added the capability too specify by package provider and source][mysql-package-options-pr], to the [MySQL module][mysql-module].
- [elmobp][elmobp] [fixed a bug in the MySQL module][mysql-bugfix-pr] which was caused by improper handling of non-printable characters being returned by MySQL.

## Preparing for Puppet 7

Given the upcoming release of Puppet 7, the IAC team have begun working with our colleagues on the Puppet Agent team to ensure that the [supported modules]({% link modules.html %}) and [tools]({% link tools.html %}) we manage are thoroughly tested with Puppet 7.
We hope to begin testing the modules with the nightly builds of Puppet 7 from next week.
Special thanks to [mihaibuzgau][mihaibuzgau] and [gimmyxd][gimmyxd] for their help in this effort!

## Re-Engaging with the DSC Builder

As I'm ([michaeltlombardi][lombardi]) back from my paternity leave and off of CI triage, [sheenaajay][Sheena] and I are back at work on the DSC builder, racing to cross the last couple hurdles before we're happy with the implementation.

More on this - and possibly a full blog post on it - later, but I've been wrestling with canonicalizing manifest values so we can get a case insensitive _but case preserving_ behavior from Puppet - which is what PowerShell users expect of DSC whether or not they think about it explicitly!
If you'd like to see more on the tangled web that this PR/ticket has turned into, let us know!

Sheena meanwhile has been hard at work fixing bugs and ensuring that our support for class-based DSC resources is up to scratch!
She's working on the broader end-to-end testing which should help significantly boost confidence in the capabilities of this builder.
