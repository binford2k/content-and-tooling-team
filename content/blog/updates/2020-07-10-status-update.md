This has been as short week for the IAC team and we mostly focused our attention on maintenance and support activities.
We want to share with our community some of the most interesting things.
Here’s a brief overview of what we’ve been up to:

## Module Releases from IAC Team

## Community Shoutouts for IAC

We appreciate our community contributors as they are always ready to help and they have excellent ideas. Here are some highlights of this week:

Thanks to [Ben Ford](https://github.com/binford2k) for his great idea [feature](https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/39) on community_management.

## Michael and Sheena are getting back to DSC revamp work after a hard triage

After triage, [Michael](https://github.com/michaeltlombardi) and [Sheena](https://github.com/sheenaajay) will be working on a handcrafted automated end-to-end test that validates autogenerated modules that are ready for production.

## Happy 90 days at Puppet

A great achievement made by [Adrian](https://github.com/adrianiurca).
For the great progress he made in this time, as a reward, he got to write this week's status update.
