## Happy Friday y'all!
It's Friday! It's time again to reflect on the week in the CAT team.

This week we have welcomed [Jordan Breen][jordanbreenpuppet] to the team. Jordan is joining us as an Associate Software Engineer and we are delighted to have him as part of the team. In his own words: "I am joining Puppet having recently graduated from Ulster University with a degree in Software Engineering and having gained valuable experience on placement as a technical consultant at Codec. I spend my time off watching just about any football game on the tele, or I can be found at Brewster Park supporting my local GAA club."

Otherwise, this week has been relatively quiet. Here are the updates.
