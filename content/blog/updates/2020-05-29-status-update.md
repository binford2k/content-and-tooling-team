## IAC Team Demos
We frequently demo some of the the enhancements to the [tools]({% link tools.html %}) under our management to ourselves or the wider company.
Check out the videos on our new [demos]({% link _docs/demos.md) page where you can see:
- [Danny](https://github.com/carabasdaniel) taking you through the steps for adding a new provisioner to [Litmus](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus)
- [Sheena](https://github.com/sheenaajay) demonstrating how we use the invaluable [pdksync](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdksync) for deploying and testing the same change to multiple repos

## PuppetDSCBuilder Beta Testing
It has been greatly encouraging to see a number of people signed up to be early adopters of the [`PuppetDSCBuilder`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder) project.
We just had another sign up this week!
If you're heavily involved in Windows admin, Powershell and DSC, check out the [previous blog post](/blog/updates/2020-03-30-dsc-announcement.md) from [Michael](https://github.com/michaeltlombardi) which outlines the functionality and how to get in touch with us to participate!

That's a wrap for this week!
To our Romanian IAC team members ([Danny](https://github.com/carabasdaniel), [Daiana](https://github.com/daianamezdrea), [Adrian](https://github.com/adrianiurca)) and any Romanian readers out there - enjoy the long weekend!
