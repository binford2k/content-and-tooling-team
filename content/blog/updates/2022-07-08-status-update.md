# What's new?

## Welcome back Paula ðŸŽ‰

We are so excited to have Paula back amongst us who has been hard at work on maternity leave.
You've been missed and I know we are all looking forward to building some cool things together.

A quick note from Paula:

> Im delighted to be back and I can't wait to get up to speed and stuck in.

Welcome back to the team!

## In other news...

In addition I just want to bring your attention back to [Aaron's blog post](https://pup.pt/cat/blog/posts/2022-06-30-changes-to-supported-modules/) on changes to our supported modules.
The changes are scheduled to happen on the **15th of July** ðŸ‘€.

Nice and short this week... activate weekend mode!
