# Happy Friday ‚ú®

It's been a quiet week in terms of announcements for the team.
The weeks work has been focused on helping our amazing support team with some outstanding tickets.

While I'm here though, I want to take the opportunity to say a big thank you to all of our contributors, past and present.
The wheel wouldn't turn without you ü§ò.

The weather has been roasting here in England this week and I'm hoping it continues in to the weekend.

Hopefully it is nice and warm where you are too!

Have a great weekend!
