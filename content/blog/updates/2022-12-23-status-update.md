## Wishing all Past, Present and Future Contributors a very Happy Holidays

As a team we would like to take the time to thank everyone for their contributions over the past year, we really appreciate the effort it takes to get things over the line. This will be our last update of the year as the team takes some time to relax and recharge in preparation for 2023.

## Team Building with Nybble

This week our team was delighted to receive a generous gift from [Ben Ford](https://github.com/binford2k). We spent some time team building and trying to get our [Petoi cat ](https://www.petoi.com/) called *Nybble* up and running. So far we have the robot built and are super excited to schedule some time in the New Year to train it to do backflips!
