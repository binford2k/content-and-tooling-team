## Quick Friday Update ðŸ’¨

I'll be keeping this Friday update brief as a lot of work this week has been happening behind the scenes;
mainly regarding evolving the product strategy and setting in place our planned delivery for the second half of 2022.

## Welcome to the team Molly Erdle ðŸŽ‰

I am excited to announce that Molly Erdle will be joining the CAT team as our new Product Manager. We are all 
looking forward to working with you! 

## Upcoming Apache Release

A new major version of the Apache module will be released next week. This release will include
multiple backwards incompatible changes and a major rework of the module syntax and various datatypes.
