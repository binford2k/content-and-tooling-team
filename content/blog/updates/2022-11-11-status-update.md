title: "2022-11-11: Content & Tooling Team Status Update"
---

Hello hello! 

I'm sure you've all been as busy as us preparing for the end of Q4.

To quote [Gavin][Gavin]:

![](/content-and-tooling-team/images/gavin_slack_quote.png)

That means it's holiday season now right?

I'm starting to get excited about 2023. As a team, we've achieved some great things this year.
While not all visible, we've been laying the foundations for the next generation of content and developer tooling.

Hopefully, we will see work begin on the next iteration of [Puppet.Dsc][PuppetDsc], bigger conversations around
what is next for [PDK][PDK] and focus on the quality of supported content.

## Puppet Approved

Just a reminder that the Puppet Approved modules process is running again. This is a chance for your module to become `Approved` on the
forge. More information on this can be found [here][puppet-approved].

That's me for this week! Speak to you all soon!
