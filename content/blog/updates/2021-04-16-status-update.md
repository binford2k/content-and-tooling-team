## Developer Experience

The DevX team is starting to build steam! [Ciaran][Ciaran] spent the week reviewing existing tickets for what bugs and features to tackle next, with a focus on pkd validate as the next likely candidate. [David Armstrong][DavidArmstrong] spent some time in researching our packaging process to plan improvements in reducing the size of the PDK package. This week [James][James] delivered a presentation on VS Code :fire: tips and tricks at the April Puppet Camp. Recordings will be available soon. A lot of people responded to the PDK Survey, so we will be closing that this week and will report the results next week

## Terminology Changes

I am happy to announce the end of our terminology work, as of yesterday all *master* branches have been removed from our supported modules and tools, and with the previous work done to remove any mentions I am happy to declare this piece of work closed.

A big shout out to [David Swan][DavidSwan] (i.e. Me!) for heading up this work.
