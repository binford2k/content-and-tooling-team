## New Module / Gem Releases

The following modules were released this week:

- [`puppetlabs-concat`][puppetlabs-concat] (`6.3.0`)
- [`puppetlabs-acl`][puppetlabs-acl] (`3.2.1`)
- [`puppetlabs-kubernetes`][puppetlabs-kubernetes] (`5.4.0`)
- [`puppetlabs-device_manager`][puppetlabs-device_manager] (`3.1.0`)

## Triage day

Even if half of the team was on PTO, we got through all the supported modules repos and most of all our tooling processing, so we managed to review and merge 11 PRs as well as releasing 4 modules. 

## CI and special Wednesday

Again, we applied the principle "Team work, dream work" and together we successfully ported 22 modules onto the Cloud CI. Many thanks to the entire team for the hard work! Check out the new look of our module test runs: [`puppetlabs-chocolatey#235`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-chocolatey/pull/235/checks)

## Happy 3 months for Disha! 

It's been 3 months since Disha joined the team and she started her journey in our team. If you want to know more about her work and last updates, you can always check her blog [here](https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/lifeofinternatpuppet/post_14.html).
