## First Week with the Whole Team Back

Whelp, thats it, Christmas is officially done for the year and we are all back from our Holidays.
We all had some fun, I myself spent Christmas morning swimming in the ocean near Bangor, and we are now back and ready to get some work done!

## One Year and Counting

It's with some pride that I can announce that our own [Lukas](lukas) has hit his first year with the team :)!
He's done some great work over the year he's been with us and I'm sure he will do even more!

## CfgMgmtCamp

Happy to say that both [Craig](craig) and [Gavin](gavin) have been invited to speak at the [CfgMgmtCamp](cfg) in Belgium at the start of Febuary :)!
[I](david) will also be attending, though not presenting and we are all looking forward to getting to see some of you in person, and on a personal note, I am looking forward to sharing my love of Tequila with as many of you as I can.
