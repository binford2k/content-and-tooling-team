title: '24th April 2020: IAC Team Status Update'
---

The IAC team has been working on a couple of interesting things in the past week.
Here's a brief overview of what we've been up to:

## Adrian's first week of triage

[Adrian Iurca][adrian] has joined the IA Content Team recently and this has been the first pass through the Module Triage process. Here's a short description of how this played out in his own words:

> This was a good challenge for me and a good opportunity to learn more about Puppet modules. Working with the community is also a cool thing. Looking forward to help people and improve the modules used by community.

## Module approvals and deprecations

In the past week both the [puppetlabs-azure](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-azure) and [puppetlabs-azure_arm](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-azure_arm) have been deprecated. 

Also the [puppet-keepalived](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-keepalived) module has been approved.

## Module Releases

One thing we are always happy to talk about is the release of a module, in this case:

- [puppetlabs/docker](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/docker) (v3.10.0)

## Continued Work on Puppet DSC

The work done by the team to [refactor DSC support][iac-41] in Puppet has continued with strides being made every day.

* Conversion of the build script to a function [almost finished](https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/20).
* Internal testing found an issue when DSC PowerShell modules would have versions that were not legal Puppet Module versions.
  [Michael](https://github.com/michaeltlombardi) [fixed it](https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/19).
  Thanks to [Gene](https://github.com/genebean) for bringing that up.
  That PR also adds protection for passwords being passed through Puppet.
* Code cleanup and test coverage is continuing.

To any community members who would like to be part of our beta testing program, I encourage you to reach out to [dsc@puppet.com](mailto:dsc@puppet.com) with answers to the following questions:

- What are the top three PowerShell modules with DSC resources you use/depend on the most?
- Are you interested in participating in our beta testing program?

## Community Contributions

When we talk of community it's not just the issues that they have raised, but also the contributions that they have made, so here's a few of the excellent PRs opened by community members that have been merged in over the last week:

* [Finish conversion of `postgresql_password` function](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1161)
* [Finish conversion of `postgresql_escape` function](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1162)
* [Finish conversion of `postgresql_acls_to_resources_hash` function](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1163)
* [(MODULES-8543) Remove nftables' backend warning from iptables_save output](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall/pull/911)

We would like to thank both [alexjfisher][alexjfisher] and [NITEMAN][NITEMAN] for these contributions and hope to see more from them both in the future.

## PDK

Currently [PDK][PDK] has shifted sterwardship towards the IA Content Team. More information about this will be coming in the following weeks.

## Litmus

The final thing that I wish to talk about today is the work finalising our adoption of Litmus as a test environment throughout our modules:

- [puppetlabs/reboot](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-reboot/pull/235) - porting finished, thanks to [Ciaran McCrisken][ciaran]
- [puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-satellite_pe_tools/pull/129) - porting finished, thanks to [David Swan][davidswan]
- [puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager) - The last module that still needs conversion to use Puppet Litmus. 

## Wrap-up

That's it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.
