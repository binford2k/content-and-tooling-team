## Supported Module Major Releases

The whole team has been super busy this week working on prepping our modules for major releases.
We have done **34+** major releases on our supported modules with only a few outstanding.
The release includes the removal of Puppet 5, RHEL 5 family and SLES 11 support.
If you are running Puppet 5 please note it is no longer supported and we advise you to upgrade to Puppet 7 as soon as you can.

## Docker bug fix

We did a minor release (`3.14.0`) with a specific bug fix for RedHat 7 and the default docker package (version 1.13.1) that fixes an issue in [puppetlabs-docker][puppetlabs-docker] module with a force rewrite of the /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage file.
The fix disables management of this file and uses the default /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup preventing the conflict described in the [issue][puppetlabs-docker-issue-518].
More details available here [MODULES-10898][MODULES-10898].

## Cloud CI

This week we had the first test use of the automated release workflow and we found a couple of issues that we are currently working on (the pdk nightly image).
We are also preparing a workflow to do the tag and push to forge. Link to the [PR][pdk-templates-pr-408].
K8s module [PR](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes/pull/481) is now merged which ports the module to cloud ci.


## Update from our intern

[Disha][Disha] completed her first community reporting PR which excludes the draft PR from modules report generated for the community day.
Link to the [PR][community_management-pr-54].
Disha also completed the ticket [IAC-1197][IAC-1197] after finishing [IAC-1196][IAC-1196], this second ticket was looking into the same principles as the first one, except the drafts were to be excluded from the tools report on the community management tool.
Link to the [PR][community_management-pr-62].
