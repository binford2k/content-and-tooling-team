## New Module / Gem Releases

The following modules and gem were released this week:

- [`puppetlabs-apache`][puppetlabs-apache] (`5.7.0`)
- [`puppetlabs-haproxy`][puppetlabs-haproxy] (`4.4.0`)
- [`puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager`][puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager] (`2.2.1`)
- [`puppet_litmus`][puppet_litmus] (`0.20.0`)

## Triage day

This week we had another very productive Triage day:
- 27 community PR processed by the team (2 tooling, 24 modules) 
- released two modules and Puppet Litmus

## Puppet Litmus

This week we have done two releases of the Puppet Litmus gem we generally use for our acceptance testing. The first release we finished on Monday included a couple of nice fixes:
- Added the possibility to generate a job matrix from the metadata.json of a module for the Github Action workflows we will use with the Cloud CI
- Added a write_file helper 
- Added the option to fileter testcase execution based on blog_tags
- Allowing the acceptance tests to be run as a sudo user

The second release was a bug fix that allows litmus to check connectivity after provisioning and remove some of the debugging output. 
 
For more information on the changes [see the CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## Cloud CI

This week we managed to fix a couple of stability issues with the Cloud CI provisioning and finish a successful run with 100 Windows machines. You can see the results [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-testing/actions/runs/383528880).

We have ported accross a couple more modules this week: [`puppetlabs-stdlib`][puppetlabs-stdlib], [`puppetlabs-registry`][puppetlabs-registry] and [`puppetlabs-package`][puppetlabs-package] but we also encountered another interesting issue with puppetlabs-postgresql that we are currently investigating. 

Next week, we will focus a bit on hardening the provision service and start porting over more of the supported modules. 

## Wrap-up

That's it for this week, have a great week-end and stay safe !
