Hey guys, hope you are enjoying your Friday as much as we are. It's been another busy week here at Puppet.

## Current projects and maintenance

On our side, we are continuing to work on some projects such as our Ruby 3 update. We have also been doing some maintenance work around, focusing on bugfixing our DSC builder. Finally, [Jordan]Jordan 
has been busy cleaning up our modules from unsupported OSs.

## Are you currently using our puppetlabs-firewall module?

Our first release of the puppetlabs-firewall module happened on the 18th October 2011. This means that the module has been around for roughly 10 years. Between then and now the capabilities of
'iptables' and similar technologies have advanced significantly. We just want to let the community know that we are listening to you all and this is something that is on our radar. Discussions
are underway to talk about what the future of the firewall module might look like!

And thats everything for this week. Hope you have a great weekend!
