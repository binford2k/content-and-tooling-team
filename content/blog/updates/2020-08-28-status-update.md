Here’s a brief overview of what we’ve been up to:

## Community Contributions
We'd like to thank the fantastic Puppet Community for the following contributions over the past week:

- [puppetlabs/provision](https://github.com/puppetlabs/provision): [Dylan][dylanratcliffe] for this [fix](https://github.com/puppetlabs/provision/pull/94) to ensure that conflict detection works as anticipated when boxes have a slash in their name.
- [puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker): [Quentin][quentins] for this [fix](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/653) which fix syntax for puppet 4 support.

- Shout out to [Kevin Reeuwijk][kreeuwijk] for reporting the ticket, [MODULES-10783](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10783) has now been resolved and released also thanks for your cooperation and help when working through the module self service process.

- Shout out to [Ciaran][sanfrancrisko] and [David][david22swan] for the quick turn around on the fixes for [puppetlabs/puppetlabs-scheduled_task](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-scheduled_task). Both the bugs are fixed and released.

## Puppet 7
Puppet 7 testing is ongoing. Platforms currently tested for the nightly builds are CentOS7, Debian10, RHEL8, SLES15, Ubuntu20.04, WinServ2012R2, WinServ2016, Win Serv2019. Subset of acceptance tests, tagged with the "integration" label against the latest Puppet 7 nightly build.

## DSC Builder Nearing Testing
The tickets closed out this week represent the last technical implementation blockers for this phase of the project, everything else is documentation, testing, and user feedback! We're nearing a launch of the PowerShell module to the [public Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com)!

## Time for holiday
As no summer can end without a holiday, our team member [Ciaran][sanfrancrisko] will have a short PTO for recharging the batteries and prepare for a new season of fixing bugs!

## Wrap-up
That’s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.
