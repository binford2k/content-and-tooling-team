Well, I'm back!
My turn to update you all on the amazing and interesting work that we've been doing!
Unfortunately however it has been something of a slow week and though we've got something special in the pipeline, it's not yet at the stage where we can talk about it in any detail so you're gonna have to be satisfied with the community PR and module release announcements.
Hopefully we'll have more to say next time, but until then enjoy the weekend and relax.
