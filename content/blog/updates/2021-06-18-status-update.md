## DevX Team Update
This week, we've been busy preparing for the release of version `2.1.1` of PDK.
We're hoping to have this delivered early next week - full details will follow, but, there's a number of fixes so we're moving as fast as we can to get this landed soon.
One fix to call out is [GH-1083](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/issues/1083), which was originally brought to our attention by [Michael][Michael] and [David][DavidSwan].
There's a number of other folks awaiting this fix, so thanks to you both for diagnosing and testing the fix!
Also, thanks to [Glenn](https://github.com/glennsarti) for his help in the early stages of RCA'ing it too.
In other news, we've been planning and discussing some of the next big pieces of functionality we want to get in to next release of the PCT EA programme (`0.2.0`).
The sort of things you can expect is template installation and formalized template structure.
Another area is addition of telemetry data that will help us determine how the app is being used and provide us with another feedback vector on top of the great [Github Discussions](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/discussions) we've had so far.

## Community Day

We had a very busy community day this week with the team processing **45** tickets across our supported modules and tooling. It was also great to see our Trusted Contributor helping support the community alongside the IAC team.
