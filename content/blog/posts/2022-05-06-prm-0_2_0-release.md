We are happy to announce that version 0.2.0 has been released. üéâ

With this release we introduce the `build` and `validate` commands along with a number of [other fixes](https://github.com/puppetlabs/prm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Build üèó

After developing a tool you generally want to share it with the wider community or your team.

Let's take a quick look at what that might look like.

`prm build` provides functionality that will package the current directory and ensure that the resulting artefact is a valid PRM tool.

A basic project should contain at least a `prm-config.yml` and a `content` directory.

Assuming that your project structure looks OK, you can run `prm build`.

The resulting archive will be created in the `pkg` directory by default. However you can change the location that the package is created in by providing `--targetdir` flag.

Your package can now be [installed](https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/docs/prm/usage/tool_installation/#local-archive) by anyone with `prm install`!


## Validate ‚úÖ

A validator is a tool which can read and validate a codebase of Puppet content.

`prm validate` enables a content creator to quickly validate Puppet content.
This command allows you to run multiple validation tools serially or concurrently.

The results of validation can either be outputted to a log file or to the terminal.

Running the validate command will look something like this:

```bash=
$ prm validate --codedir . --group syntax_validation
3:49PM INF Found tool group: syntax_validation 
3:49PM INF Validating with the metadata-json-lint tool
3:49PM INF Validating with the puppet-syntax tool
3:49PM INF Validating with the puppet-lint tool

      TOOL NAME      | VALIDATION EXIT CODE |                                 FILE LOCATION
---------------------+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  metadata-json-lint |                    0 | .prm-validate/syntax_validation/metadata-json-lint_2022_April_26_16-49-59.log
  puppet-lint        |                    0 | .prm-validate/syntax_validation/puppet-lint_2022_April_26_16-49-59.log
3:49PM ERR Validation returned 1 error
```
