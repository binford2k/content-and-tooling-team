Hey Everyone,

Firstly let me introduce myself, I am Aaron Robinson, the Engineering Manager for the newly rebranded Content and Tooling Team (CAT).
You may have known us under previous guises such as DevX and IAC, but following on from some organizational changes we have merged these two teams together and rebranded as the Content and Tooling Team.

### **What do we do?**

The CAT team are responsible for maintaining and developing a number of supported modules and tools in the Puppet ecosystem.
It is our mission to empower partners, contributors and users to create and consume high quality content.

### **Who are we?**

The Content and Tooling team is based in the UK, with the majority of our engineers in the Belfast office and one remote engineer in mainland UK.
Our Product team is based out of our Portland HQ and we regularly collaborate with them to ensure our strategic direction is aligned.

Check out below for some quick intros to the team!

### **The Future**

Now with those intros out of the way we can get on with the good stuff.

With the relaunch of our team, we are currently detailing our strategy moving forward and will be continuing work on [PRM](/content-and-tooling-team/docs/prm) which, alongside [PCT](/content-and-tooling-team/docs/pct), promises to provide a cleaner and lighter [future for our development tools](/content-and-tooling-team/blog/posts/future-of-pdk/).

On the modules side we have been focusing on stability and reviewing the supported modules on the forge. 
Over the coming weeks will be reducing the number of supported modules to reflect recommendations proposed in the review.
This will allow us to focus on the modules that we feel have true value and are aligned with our customers and support teams.

We are hoping to bring forward some new partnerships with a number of providers to look to establish partner modules and further evolve those we have so keep an eye out for some details on these as we progress through 2022.

Finally, with our rebrand and now our relaunch complete, we will be reinstating Community Day on Monday 16th May.
For those of you unfamiliar with Community Day, it occurs each Monday.
During this time we will triage and address new issues and pull requests from the community and not from our internal workslate.
These are then prioritized and either actioned or put into the backlog for further discussion.

As the team gets up to speed you will see a lot more community engagement from the team and we will look to build on this and work with the community to build a brighter future for content at Puppet.

Thank you for taking the time to read this blog, we look forward to working alongside our community again and rebuilding that relationship.

Feel free to reach out and say hello via the community slack channel and I anticipate many great ideas coming forward to us on how we enhance and build the experience with our modules and tools.

Aaron.
