We are excited to announce that community day is returning on May 16th 2022 and will be continuing every Monday for the foreseeable future.

## Why is community day so good anyway?

It means we get to spend time with our **amazing** community, understand how our content is being used and help level up our modules and tools by addressing issues and pull requests.

Community day benefits us as a team too!

* Promotes collaboration and healthy team work ❤️
* Upskills new *and* existing engineers 👷🏾‍♀️
* Increases productivity 💯
* Overall increase of team morale 👍

## What to expect

We are here to help **you**!

* 🕘 We will be available between 9am and 5pm UK time
* 🏢 We hang out on [GitHub](https://puppetlabs.github.io/) and our [community slack channel](https://puppetcommunity.slack.com/archives/C11LCKKQ9)
* 📚 We want to help you with issues, pull requests and product related questions

## Signing off

That's it for now! We are excited to see you all on Monday.
