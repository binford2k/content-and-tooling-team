Last week saw [Puppetize Digital 2020](https://digital.puppetize.com/), our annual conference on all things Puppet.
Over the weekend, the production team uploaded all the talks to [the Puppet YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PuppetLabsInc/videos), so if you missed anything, you can now catch up at your own leisure.
There is a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV86BgbREluXpEPnW_Bb4kgZAlGit4EnW) with all videos, and in this post I'll directly link to my favourites - of course focused on Puppet Content and the IAC team's work.

## Puppet Pair Programming with Visual Studio Code

The [Puppet VSCode Plugin](https://puppet-vscode.github.io/) has evolved into THE canonical way to edit puppet modules.
The authors of the plugin, [James Pogran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamespogran/) and [Glenn Sarti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenn-sarti/) are sharing the newest updates to the plugin, as well as some of the benefits of working with a modern, full-featured Development Environment:

Since last week we also provide a default [gitpod](https://gitpod.io) and [codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) environment on our supported modules. This way you can try out and use all of that goodness directly from your browser.

## The new Puppet Developer Experience: it's all about you

## Puppetizing DSC

As the IAC's headline feature this year, [Michael Lombardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeltlombardi/) is talking about how we finally fixed the "DSC-update" problem.
From now on, we can publish up-to-date puppet wrappers of [all DSC module from the gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages) (select "DSC Resource" in the filters) to the new [DSC namespace on the forge](https://forge.puppet.com/dsc).
This means that any improvement on upstream DSC resources will become available in a timely manner - and without additional build steps - to all Puppet users.
The way it is designed also means that from this point forward, everyone can build their local DSC resources into a puppet module using the [Puppet.Dsc Powershell Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Puppet.Dsc).

## Automate Everything

If you need to manage a lot of module repositories, [Chris Tessmer](https://github.com/op-ct) has your back.
Based on a few scripts and bolt, he single-handedly (and very handily) replaces modulesync and pdksync with a much nicer alternative.
[puppetsync](https://github.com/op-ct/puppetsync) is a set of tasks and plans supporting managing [SIMP](https://forge.puppet.com/simp)'s modules on github.
In his talk, Chris shows how it is used, and a number of useful tips and tricks for working with bolt plans.
