title: Converting to use Puppetized DSC Modules
draft: true
---

## What's new with DSC and Puppet?

To check out our reasons on why we think converting your module is a good idea, check out these blog posts written by [Michael][mlombardi]:

- [DSC accouncement post][dsc_accouncement]
- [DSC release post][dsc_release]

The blog posts cover information including:

- Why we are doing this
- Details about the builder
- How to Pupperize your Powershell module
- How to use your Puppetized module

**Seriously though what is there to not love?**

- Minimal module maintainence costs
- Automated module building
- Property by property reporting
- VSCode Extension with intellisense
- We have 68 modules on the Forge in the [DSC namespace][dsc-namespace]
- Converting is relatively straight forward

## So how can I do this?

*Old method:*

```puppet
mod 'puppetlabs-dsc', '1.9.4'
```

*New method:*

Add entries for `puppetlabs-pwshlib` and the `dsc-*` modules whose resources you want to use to your puppetfile.
The entries on the list below are the _closest_ match for the resources found in the old `puppetlabs-dsc` module; while we specified versions here, remember: there have been releases to the DSC modules since the `puppetlabs-dsc` last had its resources updated, so there are newer versions you may want to take advantage of (just be sure to test thoroughly when upgrading)!

> **Note:** You want to _very specifically_ only add the necessary `dsc-*` module pins to your puppetfile; if you're not using any of the resources contained in a module, there's no need to specify it and take on the overhead of shipping the code around.

- `mod 'dsc-xwordpress', '1.1.0-0-0'`

> Note that the versions for the `dsc-*` modules are all 5-digits long.
> The first four digits are a match for the puppetized PowerShell module's own version - so `1.4.0-0-0` represents a PowerShell module at version `1.4.0.0` on the PowerShell Gallery.
> The fifth digit is the _Puppetized Build Increment_ for that version; that goes up whenever we rebuild the module to fix a bug or add a feature to the Puppet interface to the DSC Resource.
> In general, you'll _almost always_ want the latest build of a module.
> So even though we specify Puppet Build Increments of `0` in the list above, make sure to choose the latest build for the PowerShell module version you want to use.

## A few caveats

The following modules cannot be automatically puppetized at the same version because they referenced commit SHAs instead of versions discoverable on the [gallery;][psgallery]
instead, we recommend using the next released stable version after those SHA's, as listed below:

>_**Note:** These are close but not precise replacements:_

- `mod 'dsc-fsrmdsc', '2.5.0-0-0'`
- `mod 'dsc-iscsidsc', '2.0.0-0-0'`
- `mod 'dsc-wsmandsc', '2.4.0-0-0'`

Here are links to the specific commit SHAs that have been referenced:

- [FSRMDsc][fsrmdsc]

- [iSCSIDsc][iscsidsc]

- [WSManDsc][wsmandsc]

>_**Note:** puppetized as `dsc/wminamespacesecurity` due to the name of the module changing when pushed to the [PowerShell Gallery][psgallery] vs the old code repository._

- `mod 'dsc-wminamespacesecuritydsc', '0.3.0-0-0'`

Again here is a link to the specific commit SHA that has been referenced:

- [WmiNamespaceSecurityDsc][wmiNamespaceSecurityDsc]

## Guidance on troubleshooting

Coincidentally, [Michael][mlombardi] has just published a blog post on how to troubleshoot for DSC.

Check it out on our [blog page][blog-page]!

## Some things come for free!

We suggest using the Puppet VSCode extension as it comes built in with an auto-completer. This will help you keep your pins up to date with the puppetfile resolver.

## What else is coming

As part of our next phase we plan to flesh out and update our testing infrastructure for this module on our road to the `1.0.0` release of `Puppet.Dsc`.
In the pipeline, we still plan on getting nightly builds into place to ensure that there is never more than a 24 hour lag between published Powershell modules with DSC Resources and our Puppetized modules on the Forge.

As always if you have any questions don't hesistate to reach out to us via [Slack][puppet-slack] or [emailing][dsc-email] and we will be as accomodating as we can be!
