&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although this week we did not have any contributions merged, we would like to say a special thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael&lt;/a>. Between them 39 PRs were processed for tooling and supported modules as other team members were on PTO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that we are really happy to announce that &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager">puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager&lt;/a> is now &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PF-2343">supported&lt;/a> by the team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-01-20-reaching-out.md">all the ways to reach us&lt;/a> if you want to directly contact us about anything module related.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdk-21-release">PDK 2.1 Release&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re delighted to announce the release of PDK 2.1!
This is the first release that the DevX team have performed but it certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be the last!
Exciting things in store for the PDK and more regular releases planned for 2021.
Check out the release notes for 2.1 &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/2.x/release_notes_pdk.html">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cloud-ci-update">Cloud CI Update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This week we are closing a new milestone for the Cloud CI. We finally decided to close the multi-node testing milestone as we currently have a couple of modules already using this feature (puppetlabs-kubernetes, puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager and soon puppetlabs-websphere_application_server).
More good news is that this week, the support team managed to port their first module to use the Cloud CI provisioning for their PR/Nightly tests on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/support-tasks">support-tasks&lt;/a> module. We are hopeful this will make testing and releasing a lot easier in the future for them.
We are now mainly focusing on training and educational materials so a couple of demo videos will soon follow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="other-work">Other work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Important&lt;/strong>: We are preparing to clean up our supported module repositories and the previous &lt;em>master&lt;/em> branch will be removed from all repositories by the end of next week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The IAC Team is currently evaluating &lt;a href="https://www.zenhub.com/">ZenHub&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://zube.io">Zube&lt;/a> for managing issues across our repositories. The team would really appreciate any feedback from the Puppet Community, so please feel free to reach out to us if you any suggestions/recommendations ?&lt;/p>
