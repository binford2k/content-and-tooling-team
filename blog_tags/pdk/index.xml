&lt;h2 id="new-module--gem-releases">New Module / Gem Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following modules were released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apache&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>6.4.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql">&lt;code>puppetlabs-postgresql&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>7.3.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="devx-team-update">DevX Team Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="pdk-220">PDK 2.2.0&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>PDK 2.2.0 was released earlier in the week.
This update brings two significant new features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Support for OSX 11, Debian 11, Fedora 32 &amp;amp; 34&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ability to configure skipping validation on certain files within a project&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We have also bumped the version of Ruby the PDK is running on from 2.4 -&amp;gt; 2.5.
Please note, Ruby 2.4 is still available for testing against Puppet 5 environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also a number of bug fixes and improvements.
Full details can be found &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/2.x/pdk.html">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="goodbye-james">Goodbye James&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Unfortunately we have to say goodbye to &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James&lt;/a> who is leaving Puppet next Tuesday.
No doubt, many of you will be aware of the huge amount of contributions &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James&lt;/a> has made to the Puppet ecosystem: James was the architect behind our IIS and DSC modules as well as the new autogenerated DSC modules; he touched nearly every part of Puppet that interacted with Windows across modules, Bolt, Puppet, and tooling; he co-designed and implemented the VSCode extension and language server, vastly improving the lives of everyone writing Puppet code; for the last four months he&amp;rsquo;s led this team, providing guidance and unifying our vision around what developing and maintaining Puppet content can be. Whether it be Windows content, improving the functionality and experience of Puppet&amp;rsquo;s products on Windows, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vscode">Puppet VSCode Plugin&lt;/a>, - it&amp;rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that his contributions have been many and significant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James&lt;/a> for his contributions, support and leadership and wish him the very best of luck in the next chapter of his career!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="github-changelog-generator-moved-to-puppetlabs-namespace">github-changelog-generator moved to puppetlabs namespace&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have forked &lt;code>github-changelog-generator&lt;/code> to &lt;code>puppetlabs&lt;/code> namespace .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will give more control on adding features and bug fixes which will help us with the supported module release process in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 2021-06-25: IAC &amp; DevX Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-06-25-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-06-25-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="devx-team-update">DevX Team Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy week on the DevX team!
We&amp;rsquo;re delighted to announce the release of PDK version &lt;code>2.1.1&lt;/code>.
This release resolves an issue in which &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/2.x/release_notes_pdk.html#resolved-issue-with-access-denied-error-on-win-github-actions">child processes were unable to spawn&lt;/a> on some Windows systems.

&lt;h1 id="pdk-puppet-content-templates-010-released-">PDK Puppet Content Templates 0.1.0 released ✨&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We are proud to announce the first release for the new PDK templating system: &lt;strong>Puppet Content Templates (PCT)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Puppet Content Templates&lt;/strong> codify a structure to produce content for any Puppet Product that can be authored without direct oversight of the Puppet PDK team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get started download the release from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/">pdkgo repo&lt;/a>. A step by step guide is included in the README.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>PCT is currently in an EXPERIMENTAL phase and feedback is encouraged via &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/discussions">pdkgo/discussions&lt;/a>. ⚠️&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="create-all-types-of-content-">Create all types of content 🎨&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>PCT&lt;/strong> can create any type of a Puppet Product project. You can create Puppet &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/control-repo">control repos&lt;/a>, Puppet &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/modules_fundamentals.html">modules&lt;/a>, Bolt &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/projects.html">projects&lt;/a>, and more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>PCT&lt;/strong> can also create one or more independent files to be used inside a project. You can create Puppet &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_classes.html">classes&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/fact_overview.html">facts&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/functions_ruby_overview.html">functions&lt;/a>, or other tooling configuration files such as CI files, gitignores, or rubocop.yml.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since a PCT is external to the PDK code base, Puppet Product teams, Partners and the wider OSS Community can publish their own content without input or effort from the DevX team. This enables a single tool to support many products.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-blocks-">Building blocks 🧱&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A set of individual &lt;strong>PCTs&lt;/strong> can be combined to produce something as simple as a Puppet module with several Puppet classes or as complex as a complete Puppet Control repo with roles and profiles ready to deploy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We want to enable a building block experience. An experience where you can pick and choose from an array of templates to build the content you want. We aim to be like your favorite building block toy, where you choose your components and end up with a wonderful structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An opt-in experience, where you choose what is added to your content, instead of dealing with a long list of files you&amp;rsquo;ll never use.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="customizable-">Customizable 📐&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Each &lt;strong>PCT&lt;/strong> comes with parts that can be controlled via configuration. These parts have common defaults, but can be changed to suit your environment. The idea is to enable quick deployment of templates, but allow customization to suit your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This user can customize how PCTs operate by using YAML files and never need to know how to make a template.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want a more drastic change, you can copy the &lt;strong>PCT&lt;/strong> and add your own files and changes, then use that &lt;strong>PCT&lt;/strong> without having to get a pull request approved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 2021-05-07: IAC &amp; DevX Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-05-07-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-05-07-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="community-day">Community Day&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week it was a bank holiday in EMEA, therefore community day has been rescheduled for next Monday.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="content-support-team">Content Support team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As already mentioned this week, it was been pretty quiet with most of us on holidays. However we did manage to get a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-iis/pull/321">customer issue on our puppetlabs-iis module&lt;/a> addressed. The team was made aware of this on Tuesday, it was picked up and triaged on Wednesday, reviewed and merged on Thursday and we aim for release on Monday during our team triage day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re currently overhauling our Contribution Guidelines to reflect the new processes we introduced in the last year in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/iac/pull/242">this PR&lt;/a>.
Have a look and tell us what you think!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Work continues on reducing package size and improving templates. We presented some early concepts to a few customers in a TAB session to gain feedback on our direction and implementation. We received some great feedback from this session that will help us get the tooling available sooner for more feedback from a wider audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-ci">Cloud CI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week we have put together the multi-node walkthrough blog post available &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/iac/pull/237/files">here&lt;/a> and finished the demo for porting modules to Cloud CI. This work will be very useful in the near future as other teams are starting to look into the possibilities offered by the Cloud CI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also started work on the investigations needed to support the possibility of provisioning developer environments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although this week we did not have any contributions merged, we would like to say a special thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael&lt;/a>. Between them 39 PRs were processed for tooling and supported modules as other team members were on PTO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that we are really happy to announce that &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager">puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager&lt;/a> is now &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PF-2343">supported&lt;/a> by the team.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="pdk-21-release">PDK 2.1 Release&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re delighted to announce the release of PDK 2.1!
This is the first release that the DevX team have performed but it certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be the last!
Exciting things in store for the PDK and more regular releases planned for 2021.
Check out the release notes for 2.1 &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/2.x/release_notes_pdk.html">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cloud-ci-update">Cloud CI Update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This week we are closing a new milestone for the Cloud CI. We finally decided to close the multi-node testing milestone as we currently have a couple of modules already using this feature (puppetlabs-kubernetes, puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager and soon puppetlabs-websphere_application_server).
More good news is that this week, the support team managed to port their first module to use the Cloud CI provisioning for their PR/Nightly tests on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/support-tasks">support-tasks&lt;/a> module. We are hopeful this will make testing and releasing a lot easier in the future for them.
We are now mainly focusing on training and educational materials so a couple of demo videos will soon follow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="other-work">Other work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Important&lt;/strong>: We are preparing to clean up our supported module repositories and the previous &lt;em>master&lt;/em> branch will be removed from all repositories by the end of next week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The IAC Team is currently evaluating &lt;a href="https://www.zenhub.com/">ZenHub&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://zube.io">Zube&lt;/a> for managing issues across our repositories. The team would really appreciate any feedback from the Puppet Community, so please feel free to reach out to us if you any suggestions/recommendations ?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello and welcome to another weekly update from the IAC Team.
As mentioned last week, we were all off on Monday so we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the regularly scheduled Community Day at the start of the week so only one module released and one PR merged to report on this week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normal service resumes on Monday 29th!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank the following people in the Puppet Community for their contributions over this past week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/ruby-pwsh/pull/118">&lt;code>ruby-pwsh#118&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;(Maint) Ensure canonicalize correctly compares sorted hashes&amp;rdquo;, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Hvid">Hvid&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="new-module--gem-releases">New Module / Gem Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following modules were released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-reboot">&lt;code>puppetlabs-reboot&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>4.0.2&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-ci-update">Cloud CI Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week we mainly focused on the &lt;code>puppetlabs-websphere_application_server&lt;/code> port and preparing the resources needed for the &lt;code>puppetlabs-satellite_pe_tools&lt;/code> module.
We&amp;rsquo;ll soon begin the work for porting the &lt;code>puppetlabs-satellite_pe_tools&lt;/code> module integration testing on a multi-node GCP environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also managed to fix the persistent firewall issue this week that was causing a couple of issues after long sessions of debugging and added a couple of other minor bug fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the near future we&amp;rsquo;ll start to change our focus towards more training and education on debugging and using the new workflows with the supported Puppet modules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-management-revamp">Community Management Revamp&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> for the wonderful work she did to update the Github Actions nightly report on the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">community_management&lt;/a> website:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/content-and-tooling-team/assets/2021-03-26-status-update/comm_mgmt_revamp.png" alt="comm_mgmt_revamp">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that this clean new look makes it easy to quickly get an overview of the state of our modules' CI runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a few words from &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> about this great work:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>As we promised last week, the Github Actions report from our tool ( CM) is finally up.
Also, we added more surprises and we&amp;rsquo;re ready for the phase 2 of re-vamping the report.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/64">Here&lt;/a> you can find a big PR which contains the new changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="meet-the-devx-team">Meet the DevX Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A full blog post outlining our remit will be coming soon, but we&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce the start of the newly reformed Developer Experience Team (DevX)!
This is made up of &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James Pogran&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/da-ar">David Armstrong&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran McCrisken&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DevX team is focused on improving the developer experience across Puppet Products.
One of the first areas of focus that is going to get significant time investment is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk">PDK&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that the PDK has not had the care and attention that it warrants over the past year and we&amp;rsquo;re looking to rectify that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To discuss future feature work for the PDK, we are trying out the new Github Discussion board &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/discussions">here&lt;/a>.
This replaces the previous RFC workflow of the pdk-planning repo.
If you see an open discussion for a feature you would like implemented, please upvote or comment on the discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the first discussions we want to invite you to participate in is the future of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-docker">PDK Docker&lt;/a> project.
Come join the discussion here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/discussions/1038">&lt;strong>pdk/discussions#1038&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="translate-module-deprecation">Translate Module Deprecation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have now officially marked the &lt;code>puppetlabs-translate&lt;/code> module as deprecated.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> has removed it as a dependency from our supported modules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jira-spring-cleaning">JIRA Spring Cleaning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As part of this ongoing effort, the team is spending a bit of downtime to go through and close out old, already addressed and/or now-irrelevant tickets:&lt;/p>

Check &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/2.x/release_notes_pdk.html#pdk-20">here&lt;/a> and see what we have for you!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="big-news-and-big-next-monday">Big news and big next Monday!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are in the process of dropping Puppet 5 support from our supported modules. Puppet 5 reached End of Life (EOL) in January 2021. The plan is to start rolling out updated modules with Puppet 5 support removed by the start of next week (March 1st 2021). We have a lot of releases planned - stay tuned, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a big Monday!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-ci-update">Cloud CI Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week after the release of Puppet Litmus &lt;code>0.25.0&lt;/code> and the update of the acceptance test workflows (&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/pull/398),">https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/pull/398),&lt;/a> a PDKSync across all our supported modules will ensure that all acceptance tests for PRs and nightly runs are now using both the Cloud CI resources as well as the &lt;code>litmusimage&lt;/code> docker containers in their respective Github Actions workflows.
As part of the multi-node acceptance tests we are slowly making progress in stabilizing the &lt;code>puppetlabs-kubernetes&lt;/code> and started the investigation for the port of the &lt;code>puppetlabs-websphere_application_server&lt;/code> module.
A PDKSync run with the update to the latest pdk-templates will follow soon. A lot of thanks to Daniel and Sheena for this work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dsc">DSC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the last few weeks focus has been on triaging/debugging and fixing issues from the field. Michael has been leading this charge to provide top-notch technical support on all things DSC related. Thank you, Michael!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="iac--nights-watch-collaboration">IAC &amp;amp; Night&amp;rsquo;s Watch Collaboration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A big shout out to &lt;a href="https://github.com/gimmyxd">gimmyxd&lt;/a>for the great sync up session with &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> where they used &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdksync">pdksync&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk">PDK&lt;/a> to update a number of the core modules under the &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/puppetlabs/teams/night-s-watch">Night&amp;rsquo;s Watch&lt;/a> remit.
We&amp;rsquo;re always keen to get feedback on the tooling we develop and maintain, and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/puppetlabs/teams/night-s-watch">Night&amp;rsquo;s Watch&lt;/a> team are always great to collaborate with!
There&amp;rsquo;s always a good bit of two way traffic between our two teams and it&amp;rsquo;s usually the case that the combined results are greater than the sum of its parts. Thank you Ciaran and Gimmy for your time and efforts!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="see-you-next-week">See you next week!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is all for this week, have a great weekend and be ready for the next week updates!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 2021-02-19: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-02-19-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-02-19-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="new-module-releases">New Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following modules were released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apt&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>7.7.1&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apache&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>5.10.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql">&lt;code>puppetlabs-mysql&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>10.10.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-tagmail/">&lt;code>puppetlabs-tagmail&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>3.5.1&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-wsus_client">&lt;code>puppetlabs-wsus_client&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>3.2.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>During the release process for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-wsus_client">puppetlabs-wsus_client&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/Disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> discovered that tests were failing on AppVeyor due to a legacy parameter error which adapted Pester 5 to Pester 4 syntax. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula&lt;/a> for fixing this issue by raising a new &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-wsus_client/pull/150">PR&lt;/a> and taking time out with me to explain what was wrong, as well as releasing the new version on the &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/wsus_client">Puppet Forge&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-litmus-and-pdksync">Puppet Litmus and PDKSync&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet_litmus/versions/0.24.0">puppet_litmus v0.24.0&lt;/a> release removes Puppet 5 from matrix_from_metadata setup script&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Good news this week! The PDKSync run for all our supported modules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Removes Puppet 5 testing based on the new PDK Templates &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/pull/403">config_defaults.yml&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added an automated module release preparation workflow that will trigger at the end of each week and prepare a PR for Community Day&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cleans up provision.yaml files on all modules&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Work on Puppet Litmus continues with the update of the matrix_from_metadata_v2 script that will generate a complete matrix of the OSs in the metadata.json file including the possible docker containers we can use. With these changes merged in we will update the pdk-templates nightly and PR test acceptance workflows to maximize acceptance test coverage in the Github Action workflows as this will allow us to easily remove Travis and Appveyor from our PR testing in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-ci">Cloud CI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week work has mainly focused on wrappring up the initial setup for the automated module release preparation workflow that is now part of PDK Templates. Having this feature will definitely ease module releases for everyone in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The work we are currently doing on Puppet Litmus and the PDK Templates will improve our Github Action acceptance tests coverage. For a quick preview on how the acceptance tests will look in the future see the tests we are currently running with both VMs and docker containers &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-testing/pull/346/checks">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the multi-node testing we have begun &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes/pull/481">work&lt;/a> on the puppetlabs-kubernetes module, where we are preparing an integration test setup that will use the Cloud CI provisioning mechanism to test puppetlabs-kubernetes module with the associated puppetlabs-helm and puppetlabs-rook modules.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 2020-12-11: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-12-11-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-12-11-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>On Community Monday we processed 17 PRs (5 on tooling 12 on modules), releasing 6 modules, despite early vacations starting to eat into our availability.
Next week we&amp;rsquo;ll see if we can go beyond PRs into the issues and tickets and start processing some of that backlog.
Please swing by our &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/community/office-hours/">office hours on Monday&lt;/a> on Slack if you want to directly contact us about anything module related.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-module--gem-releases---puppet-7-support">New Module / Gem Releases - Puppet 7 support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our supported modules are now officially compatible with Puppet 7.
We&amp;rsquo;re committed to rolling out the module releases as fast as we can, incorporating as many valuable changes as possible from the Community in to the releases too.
Some modules pushed to the Forge so far, are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apache&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>5.8.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apt&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>7.7.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-chocolatey">&lt;code>puppetlabs-chocolatey&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>5.2.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-inifile">&lt;code>puppetlabs-inifile&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>4.4.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-package">&lt;code>puppetlabs-package&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>1.4.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-powershell">&lt;code>puppetlabs-powershell&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>4.1.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-registry">&lt;code>puppetlabs-registry&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>3.2.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="tales-from-the-intern">Tales from the Intern&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Disha&amp;rsquo;s week 15 was very busy too. Find out more information &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/docs/life_of_intern.html">on her blog&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dsc">DSC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This was a busy week for DSC!
On Monday, we rebuilt &lt;em>everything&lt;/em> on the forge (incrementing the last digit of all released versions by 1) to take advantage of some new improvements to the type generation (more on that below!)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>we have also started the process of backporting all prior-released versions of the PowerShell modules with DSC resources already found on the forge.
Finally, we pushed out a quick bugfix to the base provider in &lt;code>puppetlabs-pwshlib&lt;/code>, so be sure to update your pins to &lt;code>0.6.2&lt;/code>!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="changes-to-puppetized-dsc-resource-types">Changes to Puppetized DSC Resource Types&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to walk these changes more deeply, you can checkout our &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#020---2020-12-04">latest changelog entry&lt;/a>.
In short:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Cleaned up some generated documentation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added handling for non-retrievable DSC Resource properties as parameters (no more flapping on specifying credentials or &lt;code>Force&lt;/code>, etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added handling for read-only properties so they show up in run reports&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Collapsed the &lt;code>dsc_ensure&lt;/code> and &lt;code>ensure&lt;/code> keywords so you only need to specify &lt;code>dsc_ensure&lt;/code> and then &lt;em>only if&lt;/em> the DSC Resource is actually ensurable (fixing flapping and ensuring resources as absent!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed bug in type mapping for nested CIM Instances&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="inappropriate-terminology">Inappropriate Terminology&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With everything else going on, we do not want to forget our effort to remove exclusive and inappropriate terminology from our code base. Here&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot of our current progress:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>31 modules updated&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 in progress&lt;/li>
&lt;li>15 remaining&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s 62% completed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="content-cloud-ci-project">Content Cloud CI Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The project really has been turning a corner.
This week we onboarded a number of modules with no issues at all, including the first module of another team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of our &lt;a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb&lt;/a> investment, I&amp;rsquo;ve published an &lt;a href="https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents/pull/74">enhancement to their buildevents tooling&lt;/a> that will allow us to collect the entire stack of a nightly acceptance test run in one place.
This goes from from the Github Actions job through the rake task, through the process rake starts, through the webservice call, through our provisioning backend, to the call to terraform applying.
It also includes our rspec tests running in that job, through litmus and bolt into the newly provisioned machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of how it looks:
&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/content-and-tooling-team/assets/2020-12-11-status-update/cloud-ci-full-capture.png" alt="screenshot of a honeycomb waterfall trace diagram showing the flow of calls from github into our backend service and beyond">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sidenote: Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/hsnodgrass">Heston&lt;/a> for more dynamic build-matrix calculations: the development version of litmus now can also calculate which puppet collections are &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/357">necessary for testing&lt;/a> from metadata.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="porting-progress">Porting Progress&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As of earlier this morning we have 30 of 47 modules ported over to the new CI.
Through the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management">community scripts&lt;/a> we have a public report on the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/GithubActionsReport.html">nightly CI runs&lt;/a>.
While yesterday night was especially rough with some timeouts and other issues across multiple modules, on a cell-by-cell basis 435 of 447 cells succeeded (97.3%) with an all week average of 2265/2361 (95.9%).
For everyone except the few people who have access to the &lt;a href="https://ui.honeycomb.io/puppet-modules/datasets/litmus-tests/result/tVLDJWy1Avr">honeycomb stats&lt;/a>, here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of the top-level success/failure chart:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/content-and-tooling-team/assets/2020-12-11-status-update/pass-fail-honeycomb.png" alt="Screenshot of a stacked area graph showing job successes and failures over the last 24 hours. There is a block of tests running from midnight through half three with an arbitrary value highlighted showing 21 cells succeeding and 2 failing for this particular 5 minute span.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the aforementioned improvements to the tooling get merged and released, we can drill into the failing cells from this view and get all the details on what went wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently open issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>several timeout issues in communication indicate need for some level of retrying to improve robustness. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to investigate where that is most appropriate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>apt: false negative as we don&amp;rsquo;t need cloud-ci for apt and github is not amused about the empty matrix&lt;/li>
&lt;li>concat: bolt windows exit code issue&lt;/li>
&lt;li>java_ks: transient failure with keytool availability&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kubernetes: will need more work to get a full cluster working in cloud-ci&lt;/li>
&lt;li>reboot, tagmail: provisioning failed on one machine each&lt;/li>
&lt;li>our result tracking is not dealing well yet with re-runs (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kvrhdn/gha-buildevents/issues/16">kvrhdn/gha-buildevents#16&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In general we are definitely benefitting (in the loosest sense) from the GCP virtual machines being close to real deployments in their setup and runtime behaviour.
Through this we are now detecting edge cases and robustness issues with our puppet code that we can fix once and for all in the modules or the core puppet code leading to a better experience for all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparing-for-pdk-20">Preparing for PDK 2.0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a small-ish release, PDK 2.0 is in the works, dropping the Ruby 2.1 runtime and with it Puppet 4.
We&amp;rsquo;re gonna take that opportunity and do some early spring cleaning on some components we&amp;rsquo;ve been dragging along.
The first thing to land for that is a fresh 1.0 release of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems">puppet-module-gems&lt;/a> with Ruby 2.1 and Ruby 2.3 dropped, and a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems/pull/156">current rubocop&lt;/a>.
This also requires an update to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates">pdk-templates&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/pull/371">provide the new defaults&lt;/a>.
While we try to sequence this work in a way that minimizes impact, please be aware that this might impact you over the next couple of days if you&amp;rsquo;re tracking the &lt;code>main&lt;/code> branch of pdk-templates.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="other-changes">&amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; changes&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>firewall: Add support for the &amp;ndash;condition parameter - &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall/pull/941">https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall/pull/941&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Friday - time for another status update from the IAC Team!
Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of some of the work we and the community have been up to recently:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases-from-iac-team">Module Releases from IAC Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve just one module released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/docker">puppetlabs/docker&lt;/a>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/docker/changelog#v3102-2020-07-16">&lt;code>3.10.2&lt;/code>&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of great community contributions this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/631">&lt;code>puppetlabs-docker#631&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &lt;a href="https://github.com/awegmann">awegmann&lt;/a> has spotted a few missing fixes for incorrect parameter positions in docker_compose from an earlier effort and tidied them up for us.
Many thanks &lt;a href="https://github.com/awegmann">awegmann&lt;/a> for spotting and fixing!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-inifile/pull/405">&lt;code>puppetlabs-inifile#405&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/mmarod">mmarod&lt;/a> for this enhancement - with the &lt;code>delete_if_empty&lt;/code> parameter now available, we can remove keys from an inifile, should there be no value assigned to it.
This keeps things a lot neater! :)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java/pull/433">&lt;code>puppetlabs-java#433&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: A big thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/timdeluxe">timdeluxe&lt;/a> for your first contribution to Puppet!
This is a great enhancement as a first contribution - the ability to install SAP&amp;rsquo;s implementation of JVM/JDK.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="new-releases-of-rspec-puppet-and-pdk">New releases of rspec-puppet and PDK&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>default_env&lt;/code> method was removed in the release of Puppet Agent versions &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.17/release_notes_puppet.html#release_notes_puppet_x-17-0">&lt;code>6.17.0&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/release_notes.html#puppet-5521">&lt;code>5.5.21&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.
This has had a knock-on effect in &lt;a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet">&lt;code>rspec-puppet&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk">&lt;code>pdk&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, so there have been two new releases we want to draw your attention to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rspec-puppet-2710">rspec-puppet 2.7.10&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sgnn7">sgnn7&lt;/a> for the quick turnaround and fix provided in &lt;a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet/pull/797">rspec-puppet#796&lt;/a>.
Also, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/scotje">scotje&lt;/a> for getting the fix reviewed, merged and version &lt;code>2.7.10&lt;/code> of &lt;a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet">&lt;code>rspec-puppet&lt;/code>&lt;/a> released so quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pdk-11810">PDK 1.18.1.0&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Again, many thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/natemccurdy">natemccurdy&lt;/a> for getting a fix available to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk">pdk&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/pull/891">pdk#891&lt;/a> so quickly.
Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/joshcooper">joshcooper&lt;/a> for his help during the review process and &lt;a href="https://github.com/scotje">scotje&lt;/a> for merging and kicking off the PDK release.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="red-or-blue-team">Red or Blue Team?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to congratulate &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">daianamezdrea&lt;/a> for being accepted to study an MSc in Cyber Security next term!
&lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> recently graduated with flying colours and became a fully fledged member of the IAC Team - it&amp;rsquo;s been quite a year of accomplishments!
Given her track record on the team, this past year, and her excellent graduation results, we&amp;rsquo;ve no doubt she&amp;rsquo;ll be incredibly successful with her MSc too.
We look forward to increasing the awareness of security on the team even further - an ever increasing skill requirement in modern software development.
Just take a look at two of the major security issues landing this week to prove this point: &lt;a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/07/14/windows-dns-server-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-cve-2020-1350-what-you-need-to-know/">CVE-2020-1350&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/07/14/pay-attention-to-your-sap-security/">CVE-2020-6287&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-wishes-to-davids">Best wishes to DavidS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of you reading this will know &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> as he is such an integral part of the Puppet Community.
Similarly, he is a critical member of the IAC Team and the Puppet organisation, as a whole.
The amount of people he helps on a daily basis is quite phenomenal, not least, all of us on the IAC Team.
We are incredibly privileged to be able to learn from and work with &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> on a daily basis, but recently, we have been made even more acutely aware of the privilege we hold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David has had to take up the fight against health issues in the past and is once again, entering that fight.
We know that he is going to get through this with the similar courage and determination he did previously and we want to wish him the very best as he recovers from his surgery in London.
We&amp;rsquo;re all here for you during your recovery and are very much looking forward to having you back with us in the near future, David.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alles Gute and much love from the IAC Team, Puppet and the wider Community!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 22nd May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-22-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-22-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of new things over the past week. We want to share with our community some pretty interesting things. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="daiana-has-been-made-permanent">Daiana has been made permanent!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are absolutely delighted to announce our current intern, &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a>, has recently been offered a permanent job role. Daiana has been a major influence on our community reporting tool for when we are triaging PRs and releasing modules. Some of the work Daiana has been carrying out can be viewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/22/">here&lt;/a>. We are so excited that she will be hanging around! We are all looking forward to have a celebratory beverage together at some point in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases">Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modules released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-haproxy">puppetlabs/haproxy&lt;/a> (4.2.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd">puppetlabs/motd&lt;/a> (4.1.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We absolutely love our community contributors, they are always ready to help and they have excellent ideas. Here are some highlights of this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to Trey Dockendorf for raising an issue on the latest release of the PDK, and to &lt;a href="https://github.com/scotje">Jesse Scott&lt;/a> for providing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/pull/883">fix&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has now merged this and this fix will make it out in the next release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Wiston999">Victor Cabezas&lt;/a> for a fantastic PR for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes">puppetlabs/kubernetes&lt;/a>. Its great to see such attention to detail in a PR from a community member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/andeman">andeman&lt;/a> for contributing to our &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql">puppetlabs/mysql&lt;/a> module and providing us with such a great feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to [https://github.com/vchepkov](Vadym Chepkov) for your &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/613">Docker PR&lt;/a>. Housekeeping on our modules is always beneficial and we really appreciate you taking the time to contribute.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-management-tool">Community Management Tool&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We wanted to have all the information about our supported modules in one place. We decided to change the data source of the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">Community Tool&lt;/a> from a local file called &lt;code>modules.json&lt;/code> to the online available &lt;code>https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules.json&lt;/code> which is generated from the same information that is powering the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules/">team&amp;rsquo;s modules page&lt;/a>. You can check the new updates &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/22">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The report for our tooling has been using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/12">same mechanism&lt;/a> since March. We will continue to build all our future automation tooling based on this data set, so that we can update-once-run-everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdksync-runs">PDKSync Runs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> has performed 2 PDKSync runs this week to include generic template updates in our modules and to add Ubuntu 20.04 support. &lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has been running one to switch our default provisioner from VMPooler to ABS for our weekly and pre-release CI runs. Travis was busy! &lt;code>:D&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="making-it-possible-to-visualize-data">Making it Possible to Visualize Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has &lt;del>been working hard&lt;/del> spent a few more minutes on making use of &lt;a href="https://honeycomb.io/">honeycomb&lt;/a>. This week&amp;rsquo;s new query will track our migration from VMPooler to ABS. It is super exciting that we can now see dashboards and drill down rather than scrolling through large log files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see when we started rolling out the first changes:
&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/content-and-tooling-team/assets/2020-05-22-status-update/vmpooler-abs-migration-tracker.png" alt="A graph comparing 1073 vmpooler calls with 502 ABS calls, which started around the 18th">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-image-creation">Litmus Image Creation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since the end of 2019 we&amp;rsquo;re using custom-built &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage">images&lt;/a> to test modules with &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">litmus&lt;/a>. Litmus image creation is now part of the IAC team OS certification process. As part of our work on validating all modules for Ubuntu 20.04, &lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> put in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage/pull/23/files">a quick PR&lt;/a> to add it to our list of images. Being able to easily create a new Litmus image enables the IAC to team run OS certification test across multiple modules quickly. Great Job &lt;a href="https://github.com/florindragos">Florin&lt;/a> on the Litmus image creation scripting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-iac-team-adapting-to-the-new-norm">The IAC Team Adapting to the New &amp;lsquo;Norm&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Everyone in the team seems to have started adapting to the new ‘norm’ of working from home every day. It seems everyone has started trying out new things. Here are some of the things we have been getting up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has been taking Oscar and Miku out walking almost daily, soaking up the lovely views around Belfast and of course playing &lt;a href="https://factorio.com/">factorio&lt;/a> for way too long. Can we blame him when confined to the house, lets just refer to it mastering skills online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Norman over the past year has had a lot of landscaping carried out in his garden therefore he finds himself spending more time in his garden than before. With the weather we have been having in Belfast recently he would be crazy to miss the opportunity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> now knows his neighborhood by the back of his hand, has taken up more cooking opportunities at home (he currently has enough Bolognese in his freezer to feed the whole IAC team), is getting a big nostalgia hit playing Streets of Rage 4 online with his mate and has big plans on getting back into playing guitar, it just hasn’t happened yet. Sounds like Ciaran has been doing great at keeping busy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has found himself spending more time chilling out and reading books and when he is not doing that he is ‘fine tuning’ his video gaming skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> carries out a vigorous home workout regime on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays. Way to go David, serious commitment there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sheenaajay">Sheena&lt;/a> is currently home schooling 2 lovely girls. Although when they have some down time she is exploring new recipes with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> has started to do some home workouts and has started eating healthy. I wonder if this is a result of mastering how to bake a perfect lava cake? I also wonder how shipping a lava cake would work!?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian&lt;/a> has started spending more time soaking up the surrounding views and has taken up some gardening. There is nothing more therapeutic than admiring blooming flowers at this time of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">me&lt;/a>, In my down time I have been enjoying walks, for a while I collected wild flowers, pressed them and put them into a frame to remind me of this strange time. I also spend most of my time playing with my 11 month old baby. This ranges from getting paint EVERYWHERE to letting her play in multi colored spaghetti or creating strange toys such as a rain cloud made out of cotton wool, tin foil and plastic bags.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 15th May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-15-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-15-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We think that is no doubt about our community contributors, they are always ready to help and they have excellent ideas. Here are some highlights of this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/akerl-unpriv">akerl-unpriv&lt;/a> for his contribution to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs-firewall">puppetlabs-firewall&lt;/a> module. We now have support for the &lt;code>cgroup&lt;/code> flag in iptables.
Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/crazymind1337">crazymind1337&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/607">the great effort&lt;/a> cleaning up the &lt;code>puppetlabs-docker&lt;/code> repo. It’s fantastic to see the open source community committed to keeping the standard high.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-surprises">New surprises&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We added a [docs page]({% link docs.html %}), where we will post some of our architecture docs and some “how to” documents that might be helpful in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="paula-continues-her-way-back-to-puppet-goodies">Paula continues her way back to Puppet goodies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is what she said when she was working on puppetlabs-apt release:
&lt;em>Massive shout out to Danny. I have returned from maternity leave and started working on my first release from I finished up in June 2019 and it is just like magic! The automated generation of the change log, reference documentation and tagging is just brilliant! Has definitely removed one of the biggest pain points when releasing.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="michael-is-working-hardwith-baby-theo">Michael is working hard&amp;hellip;with baby Theo&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Parenting tip
&lt;code>#101&lt;/code>:
&lt;em>When my kids play up in public I like to yell &amp;ldquo;Wait until I tell your mother!&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; pretend they are not mine.&lt;/em>
Good luck, dear Michael! Enjoy this beautiful time!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-we-stay-happy-in-troubling-times">How we stay happy in troubling times&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Social fridays&lt;/strong>
We all know that friday is a tough day because the weekend is so close. (The legend says that friday is actually the first day of weekend, but let&amp;rsquo;s keep this secret for us). Social fridays have an incredible success for our team and today we have some special guests.
The IAC team have inviting our good friends from CIS to join our social hour this weeks.It will be great catching up with old friends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 8th May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-08-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-08-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a couple of interesting things in the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Puppet Camp Berlin has come and gone.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/HelenCampbell">Helen&lt;/a> did a fantastic job at MC&amp;rsquo;ing the event.
The talks are available on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PuppetLabsInc/">the YouTube channel&lt;/a>.
You&amp;rsquo;ll also find the talks from the Australian or US East camps there.
For example, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqBzBVTlwWI">Automated Testing of your Infracode&lt;/a> by Jesse Reynolds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to everyone who contributed, chatted in &lt;a href="https://slack.puppet.com/">Slack&lt;/a>, or just was listening in on the talks and learned something!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="continued-work-on-puppet-dsc">Continued Work on Puppet DSC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">Puppet DSC project&lt;/a> continues on through phase II, with this week seeing [an annoying bug(https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-781)] being squashed and the first trial modules being sent out to beta testers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To any community members who still would like to be part of our beta testing program, I encourage you to reach out to &lt;a href="mailto:dsc@puppet.com">dsc@puppet.com&lt;/a> with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What are the top three PowerShell modules with DSC resources you use/depend on the most?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we talk of community it&amp;rsquo;s not just the issues that they have raised, but also the contributions that they have made, so here&amp;rsquo;s a few of the excellent PRs opened by community members that have been merged in over the last week:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A clear thank you for &lt;a href="https://github.com/binford2k">binford2k&lt;/a> for these great PRs on the postgresql module:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1168">Mark version param as deprecated in server.pp comments&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1167">service_ensure =&amp;gt; true is now an allowed value (aliased to running)&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Another big thank you for &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexjfisher">alexjfisher&lt;/a> on his great contributions to the apache module:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2023">Replace &lt;code>validate_apache_loglevel&lt;/code> method with data type&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2024">Tidy up &lt;code>pw_hash&lt;/code> function&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall/pull/916">Add support for cgroup arg - firewall&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="short-week">Short week&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With Friday being a bank holiday in the UK and May 1st being a bank holiday in Romania &lt;em>and&lt;/em> Puppet taking a global mental health day on May 4th, this week was particularly short and compressed. We&amp;rsquo;ll be back to our regular schedule next week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdk">PDK&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk">PDK&lt;/a> has shifted under the ownership of the IA Content Team.
The team is currently working on our first PDK release, which we hope to have with you soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The release handover was impacted by a garden variety of fun issues from build infrastructure hiccups to a last minute breakage through an upstream gem.
Worry not, the release is still inevitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 01st May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-01-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-01-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="module-releases">Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One thing we are always happy to talk about is the release of a module, in this case:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/inifile">puppetlabs/inifile&lt;/a> (v4.2.0)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">Puppet DSC project&lt;/a> continues on through phase II, with this week seeing the ability to puppetize a PowerShell module&amp;rsquo;s DSC resources with a single command (&lt;code>New-PuppetDscModule&lt;/code>), as well as improving the output modules themselves, ensuring that their reference documentation and README are generated.
The other big change in the last week was to the underlying provider and type generation, improving debuggability and fully mapping embedded CIM instances!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To any community members who would like to be part of our beta testing program, I encourage you to reach out to &lt;a href="mailto:dsc@puppet.com">dsc@puppet.com&lt;/a> with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a couple of interesting things in the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adrians-first-week-of-triage">Adrian&amp;rsquo;s first week of triage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian Iurca&lt;/a> has joined the IA Content Team recently and this has been the first pass through the Module Triage process. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short description of how this played out in his own words:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This was a good challenge for me and a good opportunity to learn more about Puppet modules. Working with the community is also a cool thing. Looking forward to help people and improve the modules used by community.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="module-approvals-and-deprecations">Module approvals and deprecations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the past week both the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-azure">puppetlabs-azure&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-azure_arm">puppetlabs-azure_arm&lt;/a> have been deprecated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also the &lt;a href="https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-keepalived">puppet-keepalived&lt;/a> module has been approved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases">Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One thing we are always happy to talk about is the release of a module, in this case:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/docker">puppetlabs/docker&lt;/a> (v3.10.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="continued-work-on-puppet-dsc">Continued Work on Puppet DSC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The work done by the team to &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">refactor DSC support&lt;/a> in Puppet has continued with strides being made every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Conversion of the build script to a function &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/20">almost finished&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Internal testing found an issue when DSC PowerShell modules would have versions that were not legal Puppet Module versions.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/19">fixed it&lt;/a>.
Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/genebean">Gene&lt;/a> for bringing that up.
That PR also adds protection for passwords being passed through Puppet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Code cleanup and test coverage is continuing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To any community members who would like to be part of our beta testing program, I encourage you to reach out to &lt;a href="mailto:dsc@puppet.com">dsc@puppet.com&lt;/a> with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What are the top three PowerShell modules with DSC resources you use/depend on the most?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you interested in participating in our beta testing program?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we talk of community it&amp;rsquo;s not just the issues that they have raised, but also the contributions that they have made, so here&amp;rsquo;s a few of the excellent PRs opened by community members that have been merged in over the last week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1161">Finish conversion of &lt;code>postgresql_password&lt;/code> function&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1163">Finish conversion of &lt;code>postgresql_acls_to_resources_hash&lt;/code> function&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall/pull/911">(MODULES-8543) Remove nftables' backend warning from iptables_save output&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We would like to thank both &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexjfisher">alexjfisher&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/NITEMAN">NITEMAN&lt;/a> for these contributions and hope to see more from them both in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdk">PDK&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Currently &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk">PDK&lt;/a> has shifted sterwardship towards the IA Content Team. More information about this will be coming in the following weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus">Litmus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The final thing that I wish to talk about today is the work finalising our adoption of Litmus as a test environment throughout our modules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-reboot/pull/235">puppetlabs/reboot&lt;/a> - porting finished, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran McCrisken&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="covid-19">COVID-19&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although this situation affects all of us, we do our best to continue the good work. We chose to stay home in order to protect the community and stop the spread of the virus. We all miss the office and the chats about the weather next to the coffee machine, but here we have some friends, who are happy that we work remote:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/content-and-tooling-team/assets/2020-03-27-status-update/collage.jpg" alt="Happy Friends">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/blog/covid-19-a-note-for-our-community/">Puppet&amp;rsquo;s blog: COVID-19&lt;/a> for the official statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last week we have released:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/translate">puppetlabs/translate&lt;/a> (v2.2.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/firewall">puppetlabs/firewall&lt;/a> (v2.3.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community">Community&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Puppet Community was always a part of our team and we always appreciate the contributions you bring.
Thank you, folks! Here are a few highlights of this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1156">puppetlabs-postgresql#1156&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://github.com/veninga">veninga&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall/pull/908">puppetlabs-firewall#908&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://github.com/jbro">jbro&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1158">puppetlabs-postgresql#1158&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://github.com/XnS">XnS&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We look forward to see your new contributions to Puppet modules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="customer-escalations">Customer Escalations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By popular request, the team started work on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos">Palo Alto Networks module&lt;/a> to add support for virtual systems (check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos/pull/119">the PR&lt;/a> for more details).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dsc-rework">DSC Rework&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve started work on re-architecting and revitalizing our DSC builder (check out &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">IAC-41&lt;/a> for some details!) based on prototype work by &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James Pogran&lt;/a>. In short, this project is aiming to provide a PowerShell module for Puppetizing DSC resources, complete with intellisense, help, and guardrails.
A bit further out and we&amp;rsquo;ll have a new namespace on the forge - dsc - where we&amp;rsquo;ll publish these automatically generated modules as 1:1 matches for the PowerShell modules with DSC resources on the &lt;a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages">PowerShellGallery&lt;/a>!
We&amp;rsquo;re working hard right now to pull the prototype across the last couple of miles to get an MVP for testing - if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in beta testing this project with us, please reach out on &lt;a href="https://slack.puppet.com/">slack in #windows&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-progress">Litmus Progress&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">Litmus&lt;/a>, the team had a productive week.
We managed to fix some bugs that you can check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/271">here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/272">here&lt;/a>.
Also, now we are able to capture more information for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/264">honeycomb&lt;/a>.
Part of that is due to the new &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec_honeycomb_formatter">rspec_honeycomb_formatter&lt;/a> that let&amp;rsquo;s you post all your examples and results to honeycomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last few of modules where the acceptance tests need converting to Litmus are now in progress:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/websphere_application_server">puppetlabs/websphere_application_server&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools">puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/reboot">puppetlabs-reboot&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager">puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you’re interested in converting a module to Litmus, feel free to get in touch with us during &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/community/office-hours/">Office Hours&lt;/a> or use the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/litmus/Converting-modules-to-use-Litmus.html">documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Final litmus note: we did the work already a few weeks ago, but now closed &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-560">the ticket&lt;/a>: we&amp;rsquo;re now using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage">litmusimage&lt;/a> docker images in all our testing.
They are regularly autogenerated and accept community contributions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="covid-19">COVID-19&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Read &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/blog/covid-19-a-note-for-our-community/">Puppet&amp;rsquo;s blog: COVID-19&lt;/a> for the official statement.
Puppet provided remote working for all employees to support COVID-19.
This precautionary measure has been taken in order to keep everyone healthy and limit the spread of the virus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company supports employees by giving them all the essentials to work remotely and it also appreciates the fact that remote working requires everyone to adjust their working styles.
It may not be smooth for everyone, but the company is doing its best to support all the employees during this challenging time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, everyone is well equipped to work remotely to their best.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last week we have released:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/postgresql">puppetlabs/postgresql&lt;/a> (v6.4.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/rook">puppetlabs/rook&lt;/a> (v0.4.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="facter-4-testing">Facter 4 Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Ghost team tested our modules with Facter 4 using pdksync.
Except for the Apache module, all modules passed Facter 4 testing.
(apache failed because of a custom fact in &lt;a href="https://github.com/gentoo/puppet-portage.git)">https://github.com/gentoo/puppet-portage.git)&lt;/a>.
Thanks alot to &lt;a href="https://github.com/florindragos">Florin Dragos&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/IrimieBogdan">Bogdan Irimie&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/oanatmaria">Oana Tanasoiu&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/sebastian-miclea">Sebastian Miclea&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/gimmyxd">Gheorghe Popescu&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Filipovici-Andrei">Andrei Filipovici&lt;/a> for all the help on module testing and the fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community">Community&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As always we have been working with the brilliant Puppet Community to get their changes in to the modules.
A few highlights this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1150">puppetlabs-postgresql#1150&lt;/a>: A pleasure working with &lt;a href="https://github.com/olifre">olifre&lt;/a> to get this fix he authored over the line.
Kudos on the first RSpec test!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/586">puppetlabs-docker#586&lt;/a>: Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/fe80">fe80&lt;/a> for this fix!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-inifile/pull/387">puppetlabs-inifile#387&lt;/a>: &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexjfisher">alexjfisher&lt;/a> continues his never ending streak of great contributions!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-chocolatey/pull/206">puppetlabs-chocolatey#206&lt;/a> is a WIP PR put up by &lt;a href="https://github.com/nmaludy">nmaludy&lt;/a> doing the hard and valuable work of adding Bolt tasks to the Chocolatey module!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="development-infrastructure">Development Infrastructure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s been plenty keeping us busy in our CI infrastructure this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the Puppet repositories removed unencrypted HTTP access before all tooling upgrades were in place, breaking puppet 5 agent installs in our pipelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It was a good lesson how with so many products spanning so many repositories, even with the best foresight from all parties, there can be unforeseen knock on effects from a code change.
When we discovered the root cause of the issues preventing the Puppet 5 agent installing on some older Linux systems, the Agent team were quick off the mark to address our issues.
We’d like to thank the Agent team for their responsiveness in addressing issues that were causing CI test run failures.
Thanks &lt;a href="https://github.com/ciprianbadescu">ciprianbadescu&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/lucywyman">lucywyman&lt;/a>, beechtom](&lt;a href="https://github.com/beechtom),">https://github.com/beechtom),&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/underscorgan">underscorgan&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/e-gris">e-gris&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/GabrielNagy">GabrielNagy&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sarameisburger">sarameisburger&lt;/a>!
This has been an interesting issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the NTP module started failing in travis: &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp/pull/566">puppetlabs-ntp#566&lt;/a>.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">carabasdaniel&lt;/a> worked on &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-615">IAC-615&lt;/a> and tried to analyse it,
but the only thing that helped was bumping the build runner to bionic.
Curiosity will likely get the better of us and we’ll want to know why these failures occurred on xenial.
Check out &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-615">the ticket&lt;/a> if you’re interested or have any ideas.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="customer-escalations">Customer Escalations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the past week we have closed out an issue on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib">puppetlabs-stdlib&lt;/a> module.
As a result of &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-547">this ticket&lt;/a> we have decided to remove strftime from stdlib as it has already been deprecated and superseded by a function within the Puppet agent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="powershell-podcast">PowerShell podcast&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/glennsarti">Glenn Sarti&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael T Lombardi&lt;/a> appeared on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xirv6WQFmSs&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo">PowerScripting Podcast&lt;/a> to talk about puppet and PowerShell.
Check it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-reports-tool">Community Reports Tool&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Community reports tool is enhanced with an additional feature to report the PRs from tools maintained by the IAC team.
See the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">Tools Report&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-progress">Litmus Progress&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker">puppetlabs-docker&lt;/a> we have finished the conversion to allow users to run acceptance tests using Litmus in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/585">puppetlabs-docker#585&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="process-improvement">Process Improvement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are continously improving the Triage process - one change made recently has proven to be very beneficial. At the end of our rotation, we will hand off to our colleagues who are next up on Triage.
Historically, this was done using a JIRA ticket, but now we have a living document on &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’re also keeping more tightly in sync over video calls - historically, if you were parterned with someone in a different timezone, this was normal - now it’s the case for all of us, whether you’re 5 or 5000 miles apart.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 13th March 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-13-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-13-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last week we have released:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apt">puppetlabs/apt&lt;/a> (v7.4.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community">Community&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A big thank you goes out to &lt;a href="https://github.com/glennsarti">Glenn Sarti&lt;/a> for the work he has done in removing the PDK dependency from Litmus.
Also we would like to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/anarcat">Antoine&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=dhs%40recommind.com&amp;amp;selectedTab=com.atlassian.streams.streams-jira-plugin:user-profile-stream-panel">Dirk Heinrichs&lt;/a> for their help in resolving the file permission issues on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt">puppetlabs-apt&lt;/a> module.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="customer-escalations">Customer Escalations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the past week we have closed out two issues on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt">puppetlabs-apt&lt;/a> module. As a result of these two tickets &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10548">MODULES-10548&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10583">MODULES-10583&lt;/a> we have decided to remove the file permissions management from the module implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also merged a PR that will remove the strftime function from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib">puppetlabs-stdlib&lt;/a> module as this function has been deprecated and superseded by a function withing the Puppet agent, see &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-547">IAC-547&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-progress">Litmus Progress&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have released &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/releases/tag/0.16.0">Litmus version 0.16.0&lt;/a> that contains a couple of nice fixes and removes dependency on PDK - &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vsphere">puppetlabs-vsphere&lt;/a> we have finished the conversion to allow users to run acceptance tests using Litmus in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vsphere/pull/172">puppetlabs-vsphere#172&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally the conversion for using Litmus for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker">puppetlabs-docker&lt;/a> acceptance testing is ready to be merged in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/585">puppetlabs-docker#585&lt;/a>.
As a result any future pull request to the docker module will also run the acceptance tests using Github Actions hosted runners on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.
For running acceptance tests on Windows, the provision file of the module contains a item that uses a Windows Vagrant box for testing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 5th March 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-05-status-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-05-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last week we have released three different modules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apt">puppetlabs/apt&lt;/a> (v7.4.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/mysql">puppetlabs/mysql&lt;/a> (v10.4.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/reboot">puppetlabs/reboot&lt;/a> (v3.0.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="customer-escalations">Customer Escalations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the past week we have closed out one major piece of customer escalation for the &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-350">mysql&lt;/a> module and we have also begun work on another that has been raised regarding the &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10581">reboot&lt;/a> module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Work has also been started on improvements to the SqlServer module, with multiple issues raised being worked on concurrently, said issues being detailed in the following tickets: &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/FM-8879">FM-8879&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-3934">MODULES-3934&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-5071">MODULES-5071&lt;/a>. Big thanks go out to Bill Hurt for his acceptance in this matter, his advice, guidance and the work he has put in directly have been invaluable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-progress">Litmus Progress&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our work on converting our tests to Litmus has been ongoing with one module, MySQL having been fully converted and another, vSphere being in the process of recieving its final reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally in regards to the progress we made with Docker we are facing some challenges in regards to Windows support but we have made good progress and expect even more in the future, the changes can be seen &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/585">in this PR&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 28th Feb 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-02-28-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-02-28-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No modules were released since last week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/jmangt">@jmangt&lt;/a> for their improvements to the provision module,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/provision/pull/103">adding support for sssh&amp;rsquo;ing to vagrant boxes where root is not allowed to ssh&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/provision/pull/101">ensuring the vagrant provision task works against paths with spaces in them&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="concurrent-ruby-issues--patch">Concurrent Ruby Issues &amp;amp; Patch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-556">ruby segfault problems in Travis discovered last week&lt;/a> now have a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems/pull/124/files">bandaid&lt;/a>, released in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#044">puppet-module-gems &lt;code>0.4.4&lt;/code>&lt;/a> - this patch ensures that concurrent-ruby &lt;code>1.1.6&lt;/code> is not installed. This has restored CI functionality for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="weekly-test-runs">Weekly Test Runs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Numerous PRs went through this week to ensure 44 modules (all those supported modules which have been converted to Litmus so far) run weekly tests via GitHub Actions.
These tests run against the master branch executing the full test suite - all of the spec tests and then all of the acceptance tests against the full matrix of operating systems for that module (defined in the &lt;code>release_checks&lt;/code> section of the &lt;code>provision.yaml&lt;/code> for that module).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These results are recorded to the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">Community Dashboard&lt;/a> in the &lt;code>Github Actions Report&lt;/code> tab, which shows the test results for the last five runs for each workflow and module.
Right now, these results are recorded fairly simply, listing the run number, the branch the tests ran against, and whether they passed or failed.
In the future, we will be improving the usefulness of this dashboard in numerous ways, but for now we just wanted a way to get some quick visualization for triage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updated-tools-pages">Updated Tools Page(s)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week we also updated the page on this site for the tools we maintain - each project header now also leads to a page for that tool with additional information.
We&amp;rsquo;ve collected some at-a-glance badges for each of the projects too.
We hope this will make keeping up with the available tooling a little easier!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-modulebuilder-gem-010-release">puppet-modulebuilder Gem 0.1.0 Release&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we mentioned last week, we&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-532">been working&lt;/a> with the PDE and Night Watch teams at Puppet on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-modulebuilder">puppet-modulebuilder&lt;/a> gem, which has now &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet-modulebuilder/versions/0.1.0">been released&lt;/a>!
This will carry the actual functionality for &lt;code>pdk build&lt;/code> and allow third-party tools to re-use the same functionality without having to pull in the whole PDK.
A new Litmus release is ongoing to take advantage of this new development!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks a lot to &lt;a href="https://github.com/glennsarti">Glenn Sarti&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/florindragos">Florin Dragos&lt;/a> for helping out with everything!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="facter-4-incoming">Facter 4 Incoming&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We started doing some prep work this week as &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter-ng">Facter&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s next major update has &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/facter/versions/4.0.8.pre">become available as prerelease&lt;/a>.
Facter 4 is a return to Ruby from C++ which allows deeper integration with the rest of our modules and test-tooling, and easier hacking on the core facts.
First we&amp;rsquo;ve got some checking and verifying to do as this major version rolls out to ensure a smooth experience for everyone.
If you want to try it out in your module&amp;rsquo;s unit tests, specify &lt;code>FACTER_GEM_VERSION='4.0.8.pre'&lt;/code> in your environment before any bundle or PDK commands.
Let us know in the &lt;a href="https://puppetcommunity.slack.com/archives/C0W1X7ZAL">#puppet-dev&lt;/a> channel on the &lt;a href="http://slack.puppet.com/">community slack&lt;/a> how it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should have more on this in the near future, particularly any advice and guidance around what it will mean for you as module developers and consumers - the expected release date is March 11th, 2020!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdk-1170-release">PDK 1.17.0 Release&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1170-2020-02-27">new release of the PDK&lt;/a> is here with initial support for control repos, system-level settings, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/compare/1.16.0...1.17.0">numerous template updates&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-puppet-blog-on-de-forking-a-module">New Puppet Blog on De-Forking a Module&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/genebean">Gene Liverman&lt;/a>, a senior SRE at Puppet, &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/blog/de-forking-a-puppet-module/">wrote a blog post on the main Puppet blog this week for de-forking a Puppet module&lt;/a> - essentially, what to do when you want to incorporate upstream changes back into a project you&amp;rsquo;ve forked.
Great work on a topic that comes up fairly often in the open source world!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppetcamp-berlin-2020">PuppetCamp Berlin 2020&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In two weeks the sold out &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/puppet-camp-berlin-tickets-84908295999">PuppetCamp Berlin&lt;/a> will happen at the AWS OpsWorks offices, with a great showing of folks from the community and Puppet.
If you&amp;rsquo;re one of the lucky ones with a ticket, come and say hi to Melissa Casburn, our UX architect, &lt;a href="https://github.com/binford2k">@binford2k&lt;/a>, community shepherd, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">@DavidS&lt;/a>, tech lead of IAC.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
