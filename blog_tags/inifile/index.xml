&lt;p>Hi everybody!
Here&amp;rsquo;s an update from the IAC Team for the week that was.
It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that it has been quite an eventful week with some unexpected fires, here and there.
Nothing we and our wonderful Puppet colleagues can&amp;rsquo;t get on top of, but, worth highlighting as this week&amp;rsquo;s update may be a little light!
We&amp;rsquo;ll divulge more details in due course, after we&amp;rsquo;re on top of the fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of fires, we hope that any of our Community members and Puppet colleagues on the US West Coast are keeping safe at the moment and that life hasn&amp;rsquo;t been impacted too adversely with the wildfires coarsing through many parts of California, Washington and of course, our HQ&amp;rsquo;s home state of Oregon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay safe!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="welcome-back-david">Welcome Back David!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many of you in the Community (and of course, Puppet!) will know who &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> is - he is definitely one of the most integral members of both the Community and Puppet, interally.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> had to take some time away back in July - we mentioned this in our &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/team/status/2020/07/17/status-update.html">2020-07-17 blog post&lt;/a>.
We&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>extremely&lt;/em> happy to be able to formally welcome &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> back - for the two months or so you were away, it certainly highlighted how pivotal you are to the IAC Team!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sure everyone in the wider Puppet Community are also glad to see you back too! :)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases-from-iac-team">Module Releases from IAC Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have two modules released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-inifile">puppetlabs-inifile&lt;/a> (&lt;code>v.4.3.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp">puppetlabs-ntp&lt;/a> (&lt;code>v.8.4.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2063">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apache#2063&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: We&amp;rsquo;d lke to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbarrientos">nbarrientos&lt;/a> for his fix that ensures the correct default shared lib path for &lt;code>mod_wsgi&lt;/code> on RHEL 8.
The responsiveness was very much appreciated by the team - a pleasure working with you!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-7--ruby-27-testing">Puppet 7 &amp;amp; Ruby 2.7 Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We continue to expand the integration testing effort of the Puppet 7 nightly builds against our core, [supported modules]({% link modules.html %}).
Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sheenaajay">Sheena&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/norman-heaney-b52bb5">Norman&lt;/a> for leading the test effort whilst I was out on vacation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dishas-second-week">Disha&amp;rsquo;s Second Week&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We didn&amp;rsquo;t scare &lt;a href="https://github.com/disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> off, by the looks of things, so we must be doing something right :)
&lt;a href="https://github.com/disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> has been working through some training material set out by the team and here&amp;rsquo;s how she&amp;rsquo;s been getting on so far, in her own words:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am currently working on the learning VM quest guide with &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> to solve an issue for verifying certificates.
We hope to get this issue resolved soon so that I can continue with the learning VM training.
The link to the Quest Guide for the Puppet Learning VM is &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-quest-guide">here&lt;/a>.
I also had a quick session with &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> to learn markdown language for writing weekly team blogs.
I will be exploring markdown language via this &lt;a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">tutorial&lt;/a> provided by &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a>.
There will be a dedicated training session on markdown language in the coming weeks.&lt;br>
Thank you to the team of IAC for helping me this week in the training sessions!
I am now looking forward to next week and all the exciting stuff to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Glad to have you on board &lt;a href="https://github.com/disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> and great to see you progressing really well in such a short space of time! :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for this week from the IAC Team! Stay safe!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 17th July 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-07-17-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-07-17-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Friday - time for another status update from the IAC Team!
Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of some of the work we and the community have been up to recently:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases-from-iac-team">Module Releases from IAC Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve just one module released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/docker">puppetlabs/docker&lt;/a>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/docker/changelog#v3102-2020-07-16">&lt;code>3.10.2&lt;/code>&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of great community contributions this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/631">&lt;code>puppetlabs-docker#631&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &lt;a href="https://github.com/awegmann">awegmann&lt;/a> has spotted a few missing fixes for incorrect parameter positions in docker_compose from an earlier effort and tidied them up for us.
Many thanks &lt;a href="https://github.com/awegmann">awegmann&lt;/a> for spotting and fixing!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-inifile/pull/405">&lt;code>puppetlabs-inifile#405&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/mmarod">mmarod&lt;/a> for this enhancement - with the &lt;code>delete_if_empty&lt;/code> parameter now available, we can remove keys from an inifile, should there be no value assigned to it.
This keeps things a lot neater! :)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java/pull/433">&lt;code>puppetlabs-java#433&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: A big thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/timdeluxe">timdeluxe&lt;/a> for your first contribution to Puppet!
This is a great enhancement as a first contribution - the ability to install SAP&amp;rsquo;s implementation of JVM/JDK.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="new-releases-of-rspec-puppet-and-pdk">New releases of rspec-puppet and PDK&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>default_env&lt;/code> method was removed in the release of Puppet Agent versions &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.17/release_notes_puppet.html#release_notes_puppet_x-17-0">&lt;code>6.17.0&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/release_notes.html#puppet-5521">&lt;code>5.5.21&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.
This has had a knock-on effect in &lt;a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet">&lt;code>rspec-puppet&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk">&lt;code>pdk&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, so there have been two new releases we want to draw your attention to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rspec-puppet-2710">rspec-puppet 2.7.10&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sgnn7">sgnn7&lt;/a> for the quick turnaround and fix provided in &lt;a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet/pull/797">rspec-puppet#796&lt;/a>.
Also, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/scotje">scotje&lt;/a> for getting the fix reviewed, merged and version &lt;code>2.7.10&lt;/code> of &lt;a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet">&lt;code>rspec-puppet&lt;/code>&lt;/a> released so quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pdk-11810">PDK 1.18.1.0&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Again, many thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/natemccurdy">natemccurdy&lt;/a> for getting a fix available to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk">pdk&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/pull/891">pdk#891&lt;/a> so quickly.
Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/joshcooper">joshcooper&lt;/a> for his help during the review process and &lt;a href="https://github.com/scotje">scotje&lt;/a> for merging and kicking off the PDK release.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="red-or-blue-team">Red or Blue Team?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to congratulate &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">daianamezdrea&lt;/a> for being accepted to study an MSc in Cyber Security next term!
&lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> recently graduated with flying colours and became a fully fledged member of the IAC Team - it&amp;rsquo;s been quite a year of accomplishments!
Given her track record on the team, this past year, and her excellent graduation results, we&amp;rsquo;ve no doubt she&amp;rsquo;ll be incredibly successful with her MSc too.
We look forward to increasing the awareness of security on the team even further - an ever increasing skill requirement in modern software development.
Just take a look at two of the major security issues landing this week to prove this point: &lt;a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/07/14/windows-dns-server-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-cve-2020-1350-what-you-need-to-know/">CVE-2020-1350&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/07/14/pay-attention-to-your-sap-security/">CVE-2020-6287&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-wishes-to-davids">Best wishes to DavidS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of you reading this will know &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> as he is such an integral part of the Puppet Community.
Similarly, he is a critical member of the IAC Team and the Puppet organisation, as a whole.
The amount of people he helps on a daily basis is quite phenomenal, not least, all of us on the IAC Team.
We are incredibly privileged to be able to learn from and work with &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> on a daily basis, but recently, we have been made even more acutely aware of the privilege we hold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David has had to take up the fight against health issues in the past and is once again, entering that fight.
We know that he is going to get through this with the similar courage and determination he did previously and we want to wish him the very best as he recovers from his surgery in London.
We&amp;rsquo;re all here for you during your recovery and are very much looking forward to having you back with us in the near future, David.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alles Gute and much love from the IAC Team, Puppet and the wider Community!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
