&lt;h2 id="spring-cleaning-guide">Spring Cleaning Guide&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://dev.to/raphink">Raphaël Pinson&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://www.camptocamp.com">Camptocamp&lt;/a> fame has published a guide to &lt;a href="https://dev.to/camptocamp-ops/cleaning-up-puppet-code-4da2">Cleaning up Puppet Code&lt;/a> using puppet-lint, the PDK and unused code detection using their puppet-ghostbuster project.
Check it out for a breath of fresh air in your control repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="devx-templates-and-rspec-puppet">DevX: Templates and rspec-puppet&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re making good progress on the limited availability release of the new templating feature for PDK and are still on track to have this available at the end of the month.
Alongside that, we released version &lt;code>v2.9.0&lt;/code> of &lt;code>rspec-puppet&lt;/code>.
Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David Schmitt&lt;/a> for his help in getting this over the line!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kubernetes-120-and-sonobuoy-conformance-testing">Kubernetes 1.20 and Sonobuoy Conformance Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are very close to finish the certification for our k8s module with 1.20 version.
First we added support for the new version and now we&amp;rsquo;re working with AWS for Sonobuoy k8s conformance testing, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in how we&amp;rsquo;re doing check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes/pull/512">the PR&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dropsonde-transition-to-the-iac-team">Dropsonde transition to the IAC Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week was really interesting.
&lt;a href="https://dev.to/binford2k/telemetry-that-doesn-t-suck-na2">Dropsonde&lt;/a> is a flexible framework for collecting metrics from puppet installations.
Deploying this will provide insight into how modules are used for the community.
We have just finished the Level of Effort and have broken down the work into &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1608">small tasks&lt;/a> to enable a successful transition.
We have now started a deep dive and 2 PRs have been submitted to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/dropsonde">dropsonde repo&lt;/a>.
Will will continue to provide weekly updates on the hottest tool currently on our plate!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dsc-going-live">DSC: Going Live&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have some exciting news for you about Puppet&amp;rsquo;s support for the PowerShell DSC configuration framework for Windows.
In short, content from the PowerShell Gallery will simply appear on the Puppet Forge and can be added to your Puppetfile and used just like any other Puppet module.
This makes it by far the most flexible and maintainable iteration of DSC integration we&amp;rsquo;ve ever had.
Pick and choose whatever DSC Resources you want and get all the VSCode IntelliSense magic you&amp;rsquo;ve come to expect.
Read more on &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/blog/powershell-dsc-the-next-generation/">the puppet blog&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="windows-long-paths-in-ruby">Windows Long Paths in Ruby&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During our ongoing work for integrating with DSC, we stubbed our toes hard against an old, familiar frenemy in ruby: long path support on Windows.
Windows has supported paths longer than 260 characters for &lt;em>years&lt;/em> now, but Ruby couldn&amp;rsquo;t ever take advantage of that.
If you needed long file paths in your code, you had to specify the LFN NTFS syntax (prepending&lt;code>\\?\&lt;/code>) which was&amp;hellip; not very friendly or memorable.
Luckily however, &lt;a href="https://github.com/GabrielNagy">Gabriel Nagy&lt;/a> submitted a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/4505">patch to core ruby&lt;/a> which was merged this week which just solves this problem for everyone (who uses a release of ruby which includes the patch)!
As long as your modern Windows systems are configured for long path support, Ruby will now happily work with 300+ character paths, no sweat!
This is &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> for Windows users and developers on Ruby, which also means Windows users and developers of Puppet!
We really can&amp;rsquo;t overstate what a thorn in our foot this has been how grateful we are to Gabi for resolving it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 2021-04-02: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-04-02-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-04-02-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Hello to all from our beloved community and welcome to our weekly update from the IAC Team.
Special greetings for your contributions, it means a lot for us and helps Puppet Open Source Community to grow and become strong day by day, contribution by contribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank the following people in the Puppet Community for their contributions over this past week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2138">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apache#2138&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;Fix HEADER* and README* wildcards in IndexIgnore&amp;rdquo;, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/keto">keto&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp/pull/615">&lt;code>puppetlabs-ntp#615&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;Allow setting user and group permissions of the NTP logfile&amp;rdquo;, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kristijan">Kristijan&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/pull/1176">&lt;code>puppetlabs-stdlib#1176&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;Fix typo in validate_ipv6_address function&amp;rdquo;, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbarrientos">nbarrientos&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/68">&lt;code>community_management#68&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;Added back the ability to manage labels on multiple repos&amp;rdquo;, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/yachub">yachub&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Check &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-01-20-reaching-out.md">all the ways to reach us&lt;/a> if you want to directly contact us about anything module related.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="we-need-your-feedback">We need your feedback!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are currently working on revamping our documentation for contributing to a module (CONTRUBUTING.md). We noticed it was out of date and referencing running tests on beaker which is no longer the case. There is a PR up to improve our wording and how you can contribute to our modules. If you have time a review or any improvements/suggestions would be fantastic. It is super important that we make the documentation functional for community members like yourself. You can find the draft PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp/pull/617">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="extra-special-shout-out">Extra special shout out&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We just want to take some time to acknowledge and thank our contributor &lt;a href="https://github.com/LooOOooM">LooOOooM&lt;/a> for remaining patient. Due to a break down of communication and a company holiday a module release did not go out as usually scheduled (on Mondays Community Day). In the future we will try our best to avoid situations like this and keep you all in the loop. We always appreciate feedback on how we can improve what we do. Sometimes this can be difficult as we are a small team supporting 50+ modules and tools and at the same time trying to keep everything moving. For specific team announcements please continue to tune into this blog, posted every Friday (unless stated the week before). This blog also contains some useful how to guides so feel free to check them out! :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="operational-verification-at-puppet-camp">Operational Verification at Puppet Camp&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/events/become-a-better-puppet-developer/">Puppet Camp: Become a better Puppet developer&lt;/a>, DavidS will talk about &amp;ldquo;Operational Verification&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sure, your Puppet ran finished successfully, but did it do what you expected?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You can find some work in progress in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/opv">puppetlabs/opv&lt;/a> repository. &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/events/become-a-better-puppet-developer/">Register&lt;/a> to see the talk live. If you want to provide input into the future of this development, please &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/team/2021/01/20/reaching-out.html">send us a quick message&lt;/a> to volunteer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-ci-update">Cloud CI Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The week we finally managed to merge the necessary code changes for the required dependencies into the provisioning service. With these changes we&amp;rsquo;ll finally be able to merge the port of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager/pull/169">puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager&lt;/a> and have nightly and PR integration testing.
The work for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-websphere_application_server/pull/225">puppetlabs-websphere_application_server&lt;/a> is still in progress but we are slowly getting that &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-websphere_application_server/actions/runs/701871477">ready&lt;/a>. We still have some issues with the puppet7-nightly version that we are curently investigating.
From next week we are starting work to prepare a couple of training and educational materials while we start closing down on the multi-node support.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="devx-team-update">DevX Team Update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re currently working towards getting the PDK 2.1 release out the door and are aiming to have it available next week.
Speaking of PDK, we&amp;rsquo;re looking for feedback on how to build a better PDK.
If you have any opinions, we&amp;rsquo;d greatly appreciate your feedback in &lt;a href="https://pup.pt/pdk2021">this survey&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="easter-holidays">Easter Holidays&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we are a global company, different offices will be offline on different days to celebrate Easter. EMEA will be offline on Friday 2nd and Monday 5th April and Timisoara will be offline to celebrate on Friday 30th April and Monday 3rd May.
Community Day on Monday will slow down due to a decreased headcount therefore please be patient with us. :-) If there are any reviews or releases we don&amp;rsquo;t get around to doing, they will be picked up the week beginning 12th April. Anything urgent, as always make sure to let us know and we will do our best to prioritize.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of things over the past week. We want to share with our community some of the most interesting things. Here’s a brief overview of what we’ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases-from-iac-team">Module Releases from IAC Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The release process for the following modules has been started and these will finished as soon as we manage to resolve our testing infrastructure issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql">puppetlabs/postgresql&lt;/a> (6.6.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager">puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager&lt;/a> (2.2.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="updated-puppet-gpg-signing-key-2020-edition">Updated Puppet GPG signing key, 2020 edition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The GPG signing key we’ve been using to sign Puppet products on Linux is expiring in August 2021 and this change will affect both Puppet Enterprise users and open source Puppet users. Please read the blog &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/planetpuppet/~3/BAyZ9YYraQA/">here&lt;/a> for more information on how to update your keys.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-module-repository-housekeeping">Puppet Module Repository Housekeeping&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week Puppet has started archiving stale unmaintained module repos living within the Puppet namespace.&lt;br>
Some examples of module repos that have been archived:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kvm">puppetlabs-kvm&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>THANK YOU for our great community members that continue to contribute to our modules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/pull/1307">&lt;code>puppetlabs-mysql#1307&lt;/code>&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://github.com/mcb30">Michael Brown&lt;/a> adding the use of ALTER USER for mariadb 10.2.0 or newer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1174">&lt;code>puppetlabs-postgresql#1174&lt;/code>&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://github.com/mcb30">Michael Brown&lt;/a> adding default postgresql version for Fedora 32&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="tools">Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week we have organised our first all day PR review for all the [tools]({% link tools.html %}) currently under the team&amp;rsquo;s supervision.
This was a very productive day as we have managed to get a clear view across the team on the current development work on all our tool repositories and close out/merge a lot of PRs.
This will make the triage process a lot easier in the future.
Thanks to everyone in the community who&amp;rsquo;s chipping in with fixes and features!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus">Litmus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have released &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/tree/v0.18.3">Puppet Litmus v0.18.3&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/blob/v0.18.3/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG&lt;/a>) with a couple of important fixes in error formatting and making sure &lt;code>install_modules_from_directory&lt;/code> works in all cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also updated the Litmus Concept documentation &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/litmus/litmus-concepts.html">here&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a great resource for better understanding of Puppet Litmus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-module-builder">Puppet Module Builder&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have also released a new version of &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-modulebuilder/tree/v0.2.1">Puppet Module Builder v0.2.1&lt;/a> with added fix for symlink handling and Ruby 2.7 testing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A big thank you for the EMEA Customer Support team that joined us last Friday in a nice social hour meeting where we shared two awesome games of trivia and a couple of beers. We hope you&amp;rsquo;ll join us again some time for another great round of games and beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That’s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
