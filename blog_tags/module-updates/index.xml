&lt;p>The following modules and gem were released this week:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet_litmus">&lt;code>puppet_litmus&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>0.20.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="triage-day">Triage day&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week we had another very productive Triage day:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>27 community PR processed by the team (2 tooling, 24 modules)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>released two modules and Puppet Litmus&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-litmus">Puppet Litmus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week we have done two releases of the Puppet Litmus gem we generally use for our acceptance testing. The first release we finished on Monday included a couple of nice fixes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Added the possibility to generate a job matrix from the metadata.json of a module for the Github Action workflows we will use with the Cloud CI&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added a write_file helper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added the option to fileter testcase execution based on blog_tags&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allowing the acceptance tests to be run as a sudo user&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The second release was a bug fix that allows litmus to check connectivity after provisioning and remove some of the debugging output.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more information on the changes &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">see the CHANGELOG.md&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-ci">Cloud CI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week we managed to fix a couple of stability issues with the Cloud CI provisioning and finish a successful run with 100 Windows machines. You can see the results &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-testing/actions/runs/383528880">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have ported accross a couple more modules this week: &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib">&lt;code>puppetlabs-stdlib&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-registry">&lt;code>puppetlabs-registry&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-package">&lt;code>puppetlabs-package&lt;/code>&lt;/a> but we also encountered another interesting issue with puppetlabs-postgresql that we are currently investigating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next week, we will focus a bit on hardening the provision service and start porting over more of the supported modules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for this week, have a great week-end and stay safe !&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 22nd May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-22-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-22-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of new things over the past week. We want to share with our community some pretty interesting things. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="daiana-has-been-made-permanent">Daiana has been made permanent!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are absolutely delighted to announce our current intern, &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a>, has recently been offered a permanent job role. Daiana has been a major influence on our community reporting tool for when we are triaging PRs and releasing modules. Some of the work Daiana has been carrying out can be viewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/22/">here&lt;/a>. We are so excited that she will be hanging around! We are all looking forward to have a celebratory beverage together at some point in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases">Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modules released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-haproxy">puppetlabs/haproxy&lt;/a> (4.2.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd">puppetlabs/motd&lt;/a> (4.1.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We absolutely love our community contributors, they are always ready to help and they have excellent ideas. Here are some highlights of this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to Trey Dockendorf for raising an issue on the latest release of the PDK, and to &lt;a href="https://github.com/scotje">Jesse Scott&lt;/a> for providing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/pull/883">fix&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has now merged this and this fix will make it out in the next release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Wiston999">Victor Cabezas&lt;/a> for a fantastic PR for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes">puppetlabs/kubernetes&lt;/a>. Its great to see such attention to detail in a PR from a community member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/andeman">andeman&lt;/a> for contributing to our &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql">puppetlabs/mysql&lt;/a> module and providing us with such a great feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to [https://github.com/vchepkov](Vadym Chepkov) for your &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/613">Docker PR&lt;/a>. Housekeeping on our modules is always beneficial and we really appreciate you taking the time to contribute.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-management-tool">Community Management Tool&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We wanted to have all the information about our supported modules in one place. We decided to change the data source of the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">Community Tool&lt;/a> from a local file called &lt;code>modules.json&lt;/code> to the online available &lt;code>https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules.json&lt;/code> which is generated from the same information that is powering the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules/">team&amp;rsquo;s modules page&lt;/a>. You can check the new updates &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/22">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The report for our tooling has been using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/12">same mechanism&lt;/a> since March. We will continue to build all our future automation tooling based on this data set, so that we can update-once-run-everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdksync-runs">PDKSync Runs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> has performed 2 PDKSync runs this week to include generic template updates in our modules and to add Ubuntu 20.04 support. &lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has been running one to switch our default provisioner from VMPooler to ABS for our weekly and pre-release CI runs. Travis was busy! &lt;code>:D&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="making-it-possible-to-visualize-data">Making it Possible to Visualize Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has &lt;del>been working hard&lt;/del> spent a few more minutes on making use of &lt;a href="https://honeycomb.io/">honeycomb&lt;/a>. This week&amp;rsquo;s new query will track our migration from VMPooler to ABS. It is super exciting that we can now see dashboards and drill down rather than scrolling through large log files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see when we started rolling out the first changes:
&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/content-and-tooling-team/assets/2020-05-22-status-update/vmpooler-abs-migration-tracker.png" alt="A graph comparing 1073 vmpooler calls with 502 ABS calls, which started around the 18th">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-image-creation">Litmus Image Creation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since the end of 2019 we&amp;rsquo;re using custom-built &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage">images&lt;/a> to test modules with &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">litmus&lt;/a>. Litmus image creation is now part of the IAC team OS certification process. As part of our work on validating all modules for Ubuntu 20.04, &lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> put in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage/pull/23/files">a quick PR&lt;/a> to add it to our list of images. Being able to easily create a new Litmus image enables the IAC to team run OS certification test across multiple modules quickly. Great Job &lt;a href="https://github.com/florindragos">Florin&lt;/a> on the Litmus image creation scripting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-iac-team-adapting-to-the-new-norm">The IAC Team Adapting to the New &amp;lsquo;Norm&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Everyone in the team seems to have started adapting to the new ‘norm’ of working from home every day. It seems everyone has started trying out new things. Here are some of the things we have been getting up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has been taking Oscar and Miku out walking almost daily, soaking up the lovely views around Belfast and of course playing &lt;a href="https://factorio.com/">factorio&lt;/a> for way too long. Can we blame him when confined to the house, lets just refer to it mastering skills online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Norman over the past year has had a lot of landscaping carried out in his garden therefore he finds himself spending more time in his garden than before. With the weather we have been having in Belfast recently he would be crazy to miss the opportunity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> now knows his neighborhood by the back of his hand, has taken up more cooking opportunities at home (he currently has enough Bolognese in his freezer to feed the whole IAC team), is getting a big nostalgia hit playing Streets of Rage 4 online with his mate and has big plans on getting back into playing guitar, it just hasn’t happened yet. Sounds like Ciaran has been doing great at keeping busy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has found himself spending more time chilling out and reading books and when he is not doing that he is ‘fine tuning’ his video gaming skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> carries out a vigorous home workout regime on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays. Way to go David, serious commitment there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sheenaajay">Sheena&lt;/a> is currently home schooling 2 lovely girls. Although when they have some down time she is exploring new recipes with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> has started to do some home workouts and has started eating healthy. I wonder if this is a result of mastering how to bake a perfect lava cake? I also wonder how shipping a lava cake would work!?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian&lt;/a> has started spending more time soaking up the surrounding views and has taken up some gardening. There is nothing more therapeutic than admiring blooming flowers at this time of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">me&lt;/a>, In my down time I have been enjoying walks, for a while I collected wild flowers, pressed them and put them into a frame to remind me of this strange time. I also spend most of my time playing with my 11 month old baby. This ranges from getting paint EVERYWHERE to letting her play in multi colored spaghetti or creating strange toys such as a rain cloud made out of cotton wool, tin foil and plastic bags.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 15th May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-15-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-15-status-update/</guid><description>

It’s fantastic to see the open source community committed to keeping the standard high.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-surprises">New surprises&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We added a [docs page]({% link docs.html %}), where we will post some of our architecture docs and some “how to” documents that might be helpful in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="paula-continues-her-way-back-to-puppet-goodies">Paula continues her way back to Puppet goodies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is what she said when she was working on puppetlabs-apt release:
&lt;em>Massive shout out to Danny. I have returned from maternity leave and started working on my first release from I finished up in June 2019 and it is just like magic! The automated generation of the change log, reference documentation and tagging is just brilliant! Has definitely removed one of the biggest pain points when releasing.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Parenting tip
&lt;code>#101&lt;/code>:
&lt;em>When my kids play up in public I like to yell &amp;ldquo;Wait until I tell your mother!&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; pretend they are not mine.&lt;/em>
Good luck, dear Michael! Enjoy this beautiful time!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-we-stay-happy-in-troubling-times">How we stay happy in troubling times&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Social fridays&lt;/strong>
We all know that friday is a tough day because the weekend is so close. (The legend says that friday is actually the first day of weekend, but let&amp;rsquo;s keep this secret for us). Social fridays have an incredible success for our team and today we have some special guests.
The IAC team have inviting our good friends from CIS to join our social hour this weeks.It will be great catching up with old friends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 8th May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-08-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-08-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/HelenCampbell">Helen&lt;/a> did a fantastic job at MC&amp;rsquo;ing the event.
The talks are available on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PuppetLabsInc/">the YouTube channel&lt;/a>.
You&amp;rsquo;ll also find the talks from the Australian or US East camps there.
For example, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqBzBVTlwWI">Automated Testing of your Infracode&lt;/a> by Jesse Reynolds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to everyone who contributed, chatted in &lt;a href="https://slack.puppet.com/">Slack&lt;/a>, or just was listening in on the talks and learned something!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="continued-work-on-puppet-dsc">Continued Work on Puppet DSC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">Puppet DSC project&lt;/a> continues on through phase II, with this week seeing [an annoying bug(https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-781)] being squashed and the first trial modules being sent out to beta testers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To any community members who still would like to be part of our beta testing program, I encourage you to reach out to &lt;a href="mailto:dsc@puppet.com">dsc@puppet.com&lt;/a> with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What are the top three PowerShell modules with DSC resources you use/depend on the most?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we talk of community it&amp;rsquo;s not just the issues that they have raised, but also the contributions that they have made, so here&amp;rsquo;s a few of the excellent PRs opened by community members that have been merged in over the last week:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A clear thank you for &lt;a href="https://github.com/binford2k">binford2k&lt;/a> for these great PRs on the postgresql module:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1168">Mark version param as deprecated in server.pp comments&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1167">service_ensure =&amp;gt; true is now an allowed value (aliased to running)&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Another big thank you for &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexjfisher">alexjfisher&lt;/a> on his great contributions to the apache module:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2023">Replace &lt;code>validate_apache_loglevel&lt;/code> method with data type&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2024">Tidy up &lt;code>pw_hash&lt;/code> function&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="short-week">Short week&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With Friday being a bank holiday in the UK and May 1st being a bank holiday in Romania &lt;em>and&lt;/em> Puppet taking a global mental health day on May 4th, this week was particularly short and compressed. We&amp;rsquo;ll be back to our regular schedule next week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdk">PDK&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk">PDK&lt;/a> has shifted under the ownership of the IA Content Team.
The team is currently working on our first PDK release, which we hope to have with you soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The release handover was impacted by a garden variety of fun issues from build infrastructure hiccups to a last minute breakage through an upstream gem.
Worry not, the release is still inevitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 01st May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-01-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-01-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a couple of interesting things in the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="virtual-puppet-camp-germany">Virtual Puppet Camp Germany&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Puppet Camp Berlin has gone virtual.
We invite you to join us for an immersive and educational event without the risk of travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Join us online at &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-puppet-camp-germany-tickets-101250404686">Virtual Puppet Camp Germany&lt;/a> for technical talks from local leaders to level up your Puppet skill.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Date And Time:&lt;br/>
Tue, May 5, 2020&lt;br/>
9:00 AM – 12:30 PM CEST&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula Muir&lt;/a> will be one of the MCs for the Puppet Camp.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases">Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One thing we are always happy to talk about is the release of a module, in this case:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/inifile">puppetlabs/inifile&lt;/a> (v4.2.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/accounts">puppetlabs/accounts&lt;/a> (v6.1.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-modulebuilder">puppet-modulebuilder&lt;/a> gem, which has now &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet-modulebuilder/versions/0.2.0">been released&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks a lot to &lt;a href="https://github.com/ekohl">ekohl&lt;/a> for the improvement on puppet-modulebuilder!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="continued-work-on-puppet-dsc">Continued Work on Puppet DSC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">Puppet DSC project&lt;/a> continues on through phase II, with this week seeing the ability to puppetize a PowerShell module&amp;rsquo;s DSC resources with a single command (&lt;code>New-PuppetDscModule&lt;/code>), as well as improving the output modules themselves, ensuring that their reference documentation and README are generated.
The other big change in the last week was to the underlying provider and type generation, improving debuggability and fully mapping embedded CIM instances!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To any community members who would like to be part of our beta testing program, I encourage you to reach out to &lt;a href="mailto:dsc@puppet.com">dsc@puppet.com&lt;/a> with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a couple of interesting things in the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adrians-first-week-of-triage">Adrian&amp;rsquo;s first week of triage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian Iurca&lt;/a> has joined the IA Content Team recently and this has been the first pass through the Module Triage process. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short description of how this played out in his own words:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This was a good challenge for me and a good opportunity to learn more about Puppet modules. Working with the community is also a cool thing. Looking forward to help people and improve the modules used by community.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="module-approvals-and-deprecations">Module approvals and deprecations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the past week both the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-azure">puppetlabs-azure&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-azure_arm">puppetlabs-azure_arm&lt;/a> have been deprecated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also the &lt;a href="https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-keepalived">puppet-keepalived&lt;/a> module has been approved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases">Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One thing we are always happy to talk about is the release of a module, in this case:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="continued-work-on-puppet-dsc">Continued Work on Puppet DSC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The work done by the team to &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">refactor DSC support&lt;/a> in Puppet has continued with strides being made every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Conversion of the build script to a function &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/20">almost finished&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Internal testing found an issue when DSC PowerShell modules would have versions that were not legal Puppet Module versions.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/19">fixed it&lt;/a>.
Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/genebean">Gene&lt;/a> for bringing that up.
That PR also adds protection for passwords being passed through Puppet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Code cleanup and test coverage is continuing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To any community members who would like to be part of our beta testing program, I encourage you to reach out to &lt;a href="mailto:dsc@puppet.com">dsc@puppet.com&lt;/a> with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been hard at work over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-return-of-paula">The Return of Paula&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To start things off on a high note I&amp;rsquo;d like to announce the return of &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula Muir&lt;/a> to the modules team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paula had spent the last several months of on maternity leave but has returned to the team she could not stay away from and is now once again ready to take part in the vital work that we accomplish throughout the year. But enough from me, time to hear from the woman of the hour herself:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I have finally returned from maternity leave and instantly I can see major changes within the team. This includes the content we now own to the members on the team.
It is clear the team has everything under control and I am really looking forward to getting up to speed again.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure before I know it, it will be just like I was never away.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="the-continuing-success-of-honeycomb">The Continuing Success of honeycomb&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One feature that we can&amp;rsquo;t help but continue to return to is just how much of a help &lt;a href="https://honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb&lt;/a> is to our continuing work.
Extracting a week&amp;rsquo;s work of data from all that we have collected has allowed our good manager &lt;a href="https://github.com/nheaney18">Norman&lt;/a> to not only spot patterns and common areas that we have since used in order to help stabilise our weekly runs, but to also identify issues that are outside the IAC domain.
This in turn has allowed us to quickly reach out to our colleagues within Puppet both for assistance and to provide them with information that they can use to improve their own features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are as excited by all of this as I am then I urge you to read to &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-30-debugging-unit-tests-with-honeycomb.md">blog post&lt;/a> made by fellow team member &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David Schmitt&lt;/a> and discover all that &lt;a href="https://honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb&lt;/a> can do for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases">Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One thing we are always happy to talk about is the release of a module, in this case:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/stdlib">puppetlabs/stdlib&lt;/a> (v6.3.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="continued-work-on-puppet-dsc">Continued Work on Puppet DSC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The work done by the team to &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">refactor DSC support&lt;/a> in Puppet has continued with strides being made every day and the first of the beta trial packets being sent out. To any community members that have not received one of these packets but would like to, we encourage you to reach out to &lt;a href="mailto:dsc@puppet.com">dsc@puppet.com&lt;/a> with answers to the following questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What are the top three PowerShell modules with DSC resources you use/depend on the most?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you interested in participating in our beta testing program?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="support-issues">Support Issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I would like to take a moment to thank the support team (Elaine, go!) for the issues that have been raised over the last week and that are helping us to continually improve upon our modules and ensure that they run just as they should:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10628">MODULES-10628&lt;/a> - Docker volumes expects array rather than hash&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10629">MODULES-10629&lt;/a> - Registry_auth results in changes every catalog run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we talk of community it&amp;rsquo;s not just the issues that they have raised, but also the contributions that they have made, so here&amp;rsquo;s a few of the excellent PRs opened by community members that have been merged in over the last week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2014">Add ProxyIOBufferSize option #2014&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/pull/1101">(MODULES-10623) explicitly top-scope calls to JSON methods #1101&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We would like to thank both &lt;a href="https://github.com/jplindquist">jplindquist&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/tkishel">tkishel&lt;/a> for these contributions and hope to see more from them both in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-management">Community Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to help us better work with the community our very own &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> has continued to work on a management tool to help us keep track of the various PRs opened by the community. A new improvement was added just this week, allowing us to find when PRs where last given a response, either by ourselves or by the community member that opened it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus">Litmus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The final thing that I wish to talk about today is the work finalising our adoption of Litmus as a test environment throughout our modules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-reboot/pull/235/files">puppetlabs/reboot&lt;/a> - This port of this module is in it&amp;rsquo;s final stages and should be shipped by the end of the week, IAC team member &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> putting the finishing touches to it as I write this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-satellite_pe_tools">puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools&lt;/a> - The work on this port is nearing it&amp;rsquo;s end headed by &lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">myself&lt;/a>, and although some issues with scp are hindering it&amp;rsquo;s completion it should be finished and shoved out the door soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager">puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager&lt;/a> - The final module of ours to be ported, this is just waiting on beng started and once finished will signal the end of our dependence on outside factors for testing our modules.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been hard at work over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-module-releases-iac-team">New Module Releases (IAC Team)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s kick things off by highlighting a new module release:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/acl">puppetlabs/acl&lt;/a> (v3.1.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As always, we work hand-in-hand with the broader Puppet community to get work done.
This week, we want to take a moment to highlight a few PRs and the people behind them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First up, a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/562">pull request to the puppetlabs/docker module&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://github.com/seriv">Sergey Ivanov&lt;/a>.
Sergey&amp;rsquo;s work enabled the module to function transparently on RedHat systems utilizing the &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/02/21/podman-and-buildah-for-docker-users/">&lt;code>podman-docker&lt;/code> package!&lt;/a>.
Thank you, Sergey!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/amorphina">Atanas Stoyanov&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2017">his fix to the Apache module&lt;/a>.
This PR ensures that the custom ldap options in &lt;code>/etc/apache2/mods&lt;/code> can actually be applied and loaded, fixing a previously unknown bug!
Thank you, Atanas!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, big Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/fraenki">Frank Wall&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/pull/1245">his PR&lt;/a> that will fix &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10023">MODULES-10023&lt;/a>, ensuring that the xtrabackup functionality in &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/mysql">puppetlabs/mysql&lt;/a> actually works as intended!
Thank you, Frank!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="supported-module-litmus-conversion">Supported Module Litmus Conversion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On the topic of &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">Litmus&lt;/a>, we&amp;rsquo;re continuing to make progress on the conversion of all supported modules to the framework:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/reboot">puppetlabs/reboot&lt;/a> is &lt;em>very nearly&lt;/em> completed, running against all 33 of the supported platforms!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/websphere_application_server">puppetlabs/websphere_application_server&lt;/a> is wrapped!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools">puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools&lt;/a> is still progressing nicely!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager">puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager&lt;/a> is in progress now!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="puppet--dsc-phase-ii-begins">Puppet + DSC: Phase II Begins!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have continued to make excellent progress on our &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">refactor of DSC support&lt;/a> in Puppet as we step in &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-685">Phase II&lt;/a>!
To find out what we&amp;rsquo;re doing, the reasoning behind it and why we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>SUPER EXCITED&lt;/strong> about this, check out my &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-30-dsc-announcement.md">earlier blog post&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The technical work this week has largely been in the de-prototyping details as we work to &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-650">convert the prototype build script into a supportable PowerShell module&lt;/a>.
We &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/2">scaffolded the module&lt;/a> out using &lt;a href="https://github.com/FriedrichWeinmann">Fred Weinmann&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://psframework.org/">PSFramework module&lt;/a>, giving us some nice automatic testing and a bunch of options to improve UX down the road (including layered configurations and tab completion).
We &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/3">added our first sets of test code&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/4">added a Vagrantfile&lt;/a> to the repository to make the development process easier on our team, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/6">enabled on-PR testing in Appveyor&lt;/a> to ensure we don&amp;rsquo;t introduce regressions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Work is currently underway to &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/7/files">decompose the module vendoring code&lt;/a> from the build script into a function in the module for ease of maintenance and testability.
Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/PuppetDscBuilder/pull/5">replacement of the extant templating engine is also underway&lt;/a> to reduce complexity and dependencies for the module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the biggest milestone this week has been bringing on board Puppet&amp;rsquo;s own &lt;a href="https://github.com/genebean">Gene Liverman&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jcoconnor">John O&amp;rsquo;Connor&lt;/a>, and the rest of our Developer Infrastructre &amp;amp; Operations Team as Customer 0 for this work, ensuring that we get live feedback as early as possible for our updated methodology.
We sent them beta versions of both the &lt;a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/NetworkingDsc/7.4.0.0">NetworkingDsc&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/UpdateServicesDsc/1.1.0.0">UpdateServicesDsc&lt;/a> PowerShell modules, puppetized!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That will let them test out replacing profiles like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>What are the top three PowerShell modules with DSC resources you&amp;rsquo;d like to see Puppetized?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you interested in joining our beta test group for this ongoing project?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If you just wanna keep an eye on things, you can follow the repository on GitHub and the &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">parent epic in JIRA&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="powershell-101-training">PowerShell 101 Training&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to helping oversee the DSC work, &lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael&lt;/a> just wrapped up running the team through his [PowerShell 101 Course][pwshop], which focuses on helping with the &amp;ldquo;blinking cursor&amp;rdquo; problem:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Help! I&amp;rsquo;m in a PowerShell prompt and have &lt;em>no idea&lt;/em> what to do from here!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s meant not to turn you into a comprehensive PowerShell scripter but to get you up, running, and reasonably effective in a few hours.
It includes 12 lessons and 20 sets of exercises and is available right now, and for the duration of the impacts from COVID-19, for free.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about learning about this (more than decade old, now!) young shell that the Windowsy devops crowd has been talking about, this is a good way to get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping to level up the team on PowerShell over the past several weeks as the DSC work becomes a serious focus and to generally help the team improve our Windows support skills.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 3rd April 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-04-03-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-04-03-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="covid-19">COVID-19&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve now completed our 3rd week as a fully remote working team.
It seems like we&amp;rsquo;ve all adopted fairly well as it&amp;rsquo;s feeling like the &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo;, insofar as normal can be during these unprecedented times.
One new addition to our team&amp;rsquo;s process is our Friday social chats.
We all down tools and chill out, chat, have a drink and play some games!
Often, the team members' pets will make a welcome appearance. :)
We hope you, your friends, family and colleagues are continuing to weather the storm and that everyone is healthy and safe.
Puppet have been striving to &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/blog/covid-19-a-note-for-our-community/">help our customers, community members, users and partners&lt;/a> during this difficult time.
The IAC team continue to remain engaged with the always awesome Community to keep the conveyer belt of improvements moving!
Stay safe and well!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-module-releases-iac-team">New Module Releases (IAC Team)&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>On the topic of &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">Litmus&lt;/a>, we&amp;rsquo;re continuing to make progress on the conversion of all supported modules to the framework:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/reboot">puppetlabs/reboot&lt;/a> is now running in the framework on most of the supported 33 compatible platforms; only a few more to go!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools">puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools&lt;/a> is progressing nicely!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/websphere_application_server">puppetlabs/websphere_application_server&lt;/a> is nearly complete and entering the review stage! We&amp;rsquo;ll hope to get this over the line very soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After that, we&amp;rsquo;ll be moving on to &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager">puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="covid-19">COVID-19&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although this situation affects all of us, we do our best to continue the good work. We chose to stay home in order to protect the community and stop the spread of the virus. We all miss the office and the chats about the weather next to the coffee machine, but here we have some friends, who are happy that we work remote:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/content-and-tooling-team/assets/2020-03-27-status-update/collage.jpg" alt="Happy Friends">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/blog/covid-19-a-note-for-our-community/">Puppet&amp;rsquo;s blog: COVID-19&lt;/a> for the official statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last week we have released:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/translate">puppetlabs/translate&lt;/a> (v2.2.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/firewall">puppetlabs/firewall&lt;/a> (v2.3.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community">Community&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Puppet Community was always a part of our team and we always appreciate the contributions you bring.
Thank you, folks! Here are a few highlights of this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1156">puppetlabs-postgresql#1156&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://github.com/veninga">veninga&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall/pull/908">puppetlabs-firewall#908&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://github.com/jbro">jbro&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1158">puppetlabs-postgresql#1158&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://github.com/XnS">XnS&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We look forward to see your new contributions to Puppet modules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="customer-escalations">Customer Escalations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By popular request, the team started work on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos">Palo Alto Networks module&lt;/a> to add support for virtual systems (check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos/pull/119">the PR&lt;/a> for more details).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dsc-rework">DSC Rework&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve started work on re-architecting and revitalizing our DSC builder (check out &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-41">IAC-41&lt;/a> for some details!) based on prototype work by &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James Pogran&lt;/a>. In short, this project is aiming to provide a PowerShell module for Puppetizing DSC resources, complete with intellisense, help, and guardrails.
A bit further out and we&amp;rsquo;ll have a new namespace on the forge - dsc - where we&amp;rsquo;ll publish these automatically generated modules as 1:1 matches for the PowerShell modules with DSC resources on the &lt;a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages">PowerShellGallery&lt;/a>!
We&amp;rsquo;re working hard right now to pull the prototype across the last couple of miles to get an MVP for testing - if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in beta testing this project with us, please reach out on &lt;a href="https://slack.puppet.com/">slack in #windows&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-progress">Litmus Progress&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">Litmus&lt;/a>, the team had a productive week.
We managed to fix some bugs that you can check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/271">here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/272">here&lt;/a>.
Also, now we are able to capture more information for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/264">honeycomb&lt;/a>.
Part of that is due to the new &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec_honeycomb_formatter">rspec_honeycomb_formatter&lt;/a> that let&amp;rsquo;s you post all your examples and results to honeycomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last few of modules where the acceptance tests need converting to Litmus are now in progress:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/websphere_application_server">puppetlabs/websphere_application_server&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools">puppetlabs/satellite_pe_tools&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/reboot">puppetlabs-reboot&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager">puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you’re interested in converting a module to Litmus, feel free to get in touch with us during &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/community/office-hours/">Office Hours&lt;/a> or use the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/litmus/Converting-modules-to-use-Litmus.html">documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Final litmus note: we did the work already a few weeks ago, but now closed &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-560">the ticket&lt;/a>: we&amp;rsquo;re now using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage">litmusimage&lt;/a> docker images in all our testing.
They are regularly autogenerated and accept community contributions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="covid-19">COVID-19&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Read &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/blog/covid-19-a-note-for-our-community/">Puppet&amp;rsquo;s blog: COVID-19&lt;/a> for the official statement.
Puppet provided remote working for all employees to support COVID-19.
This precautionary measure has been taken in order to keep everyone healthy and limit the spread of the virus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company supports employees by giving them all the essentials to work remotely and it also appreciates the fact that remote working requires everyone to adjust their working styles.
It may not be smooth for everyone, but the company is doing its best to support all the employees during this challenging time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, everyone is well equipped to work remotely to their best.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last week we have released:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/postgresql">puppetlabs/postgresql&lt;/a> (v6.4.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/rook">puppetlabs/rook&lt;/a> (v0.4.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="facter-4-testing">Facter 4 Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Ghost team tested our modules with Facter 4 using pdksync.
Except for the Apache module, all modules passed Facter 4 testing.
(apache failed because of a custom fact in &lt;a href="https://github.com/gentoo/puppet-portage.git)">https://github.com/gentoo/puppet-portage.git)&lt;/a>.

&lt;h2 id="community">Community&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As always we have been working with the brilliant Puppet Community to get their changes in to the modules.
A few highlights this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql/pull/1150">puppetlabs-postgresql#1150&lt;/a>: A pleasure working with &lt;a href="https://github.com/olifre">olifre&lt;/a> to get this fix he authored over the line.
Kudos on the first RSpec test!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/586">puppetlabs-docker#586&lt;/a>: Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/fe80">fe80&lt;/a> for this fix!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-inifile/pull/387">puppetlabs-inifile#387&lt;/a>: &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexjfisher">alexjfisher&lt;/a> continues his never ending streak of great contributions!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-chocolatey/pull/206">puppetlabs-chocolatey#206&lt;/a> is a WIP PR put up by &lt;a href="https://github.com/nmaludy">nmaludy&lt;/a> doing the hard and valuable work of adding Bolt tasks to the Chocolatey module!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="development-infrastructure">Development Infrastructure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s been plenty keeping us busy in our CI infrastructure this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the Puppet repositories removed unencrypted HTTP access before all tooling upgrades were in place, breaking puppet 5 agent installs in our pipelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It was a good lesson how with so many products spanning so many repositories, even with the best foresight from all parties, there can be unforeseen knock on effects from a code change.
When we discovered the root cause of the issues preventing the Puppet 5 agent installing on some older Linux systems, the Agent team were quick off the mark to address our issues.
We’d like to thank the Agent team for their responsiveness in addressing issues that were causing CI test run failures.
Thanks &lt;a href="https://github.com/ciprianbadescu">ciprianbadescu&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/lucywyman">lucywyman&lt;/a>, beechtom](&lt;a href="https://github.com/beechtom),">https://github.com/beechtom),&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/underscorgan">underscorgan&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/e-gris">e-gris&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/GabrielNagy">GabrielNagy&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sarameisburger">sarameisburger&lt;/a>!
This has been an interesting issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the NTP module started failing in travis: &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp/pull/566">puppetlabs-ntp#566&lt;/a>.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">carabasdaniel&lt;/a> worked on &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-615">IAC-615&lt;/a> and tried to analyse it,
but the only thing that helped was bumping the build runner to bionic.
Curiosity will likely get the better of us and we’ll want to know why these failures occurred on xenial.
Check out &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-615">the ticket&lt;/a> if you’re interested or have any ideas.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="customer-escalations">Customer Escalations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the past week we have closed out an issue on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib">puppetlabs-stdlib&lt;/a> module.
As a result of &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-547">this ticket&lt;/a> we have decided to remove strftime from stdlib as it has already been deprecated and superseded by a function within the Puppet agent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="powershell-podcast">PowerShell podcast&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/glennsarti">Glenn Sarti&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael T Lombardi&lt;/a> appeared on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xirv6WQFmSs&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo">PowerScripting Podcast&lt;/a> to talk about puppet and PowerShell.
Check it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-reports-tool">Community Reports Tool&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Community reports tool is enhanced with an additional feature to report the PRs from tools maintained by the IAC team.
See the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">Tools Report&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-progress">Litmus Progress&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker">puppetlabs-docker&lt;/a> we have finished the conversion to allow users to run acceptance tests using Litmus in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/585">puppetlabs-docker#585&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="process-improvement">Process Improvement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are continously improving the Triage process - one change made recently has proven to be very beneficial. At the end of our rotation, we will hand off to our colleagues who are next up on Triage.
Historically, this was done using a JIRA ticket, but now we have a living document on &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’re also keeping more tightly in sync over video calls - historically, if you were parterned with someone in a different timezone, this was normal - now it’s the case for all of us, whether you’re 5 or 5000 miles apart.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 13th March 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-13-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-13-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community">Community&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A big thank you goes out to &lt;a href="https://github.com/glennsarti">Glenn Sarti&lt;/a> for the work he has done in removing the PDK dependency from Litmus.
Also we would like to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/anarcat">Antoine&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=dhs%40recommind.com&amp;amp;selectedTab=com.atlassian.streams.streams-jira-plugin:user-profile-stream-panel">Dirk Heinrichs&lt;/a> for their help in resolving the file permission issues on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt">puppetlabs-apt&lt;/a> module.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="customer-escalations">Customer Escalations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the past week we have closed out two issues on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt">puppetlabs-apt&lt;/a> module. As a result of these two tickets &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10548">MODULES-10548&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10583">MODULES-10583&lt;/a> we have decided to remove the file permissions management from the module implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also merged a PR that will remove the strftime function from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib">puppetlabs-stdlib&lt;/a> module as this function has been deprecated and superseded by a function withing the Puppet agent, see &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-547">IAC-547&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-progress">Litmus Progress&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have released &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/releases/tag/0.16.0">Litmus version 0.16.0&lt;/a> that contains a couple of nice fixes and removes dependency on PDK - &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vsphere">puppetlabs-vsphere&lt;/a> we have finished the conversion to allow users to run acceptance tests using Litmus in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vsphere/pull/172">puppetlabs-vsphere#172&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally the conversion for using Litmus for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker">puppetlabs-docker&lt;/a> acceptance testing is ready to be merged in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/585">puppetlabs-docker#585&lt;/a>.
As a result any future pull request to the docker module will also run the acceptance tests using Github Actions hosted runners on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.
For running acceptance tests on Windows, the provision file of the module contains a item that uses a Windows Vagrant box for testing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 5th March 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-05-status-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-03-05-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last week we have released three different modules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apt">puppetlabs/apt&lt;/a> (v7.4.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/mysql">puppetlabs/mysql&lt;/a> (v10.4.0)&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="customer-escalations">Customer Escalations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the past week we have closed out one major piece of customer escalation for the &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-350">mysql&lt;/a> module and we have also begun work on another that has been raised regarding the &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10581">reboot&lt;/a> module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Work has also been started on improvements to the SqlServer module, with multiple issues raised being worked on concurrently, said issues being detailed in the following tickets: &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/FM-8879">FM-8879&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-3934">MODULES-3934&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-5071">MODULES-5071&lt;/a>. Big thanks go out to Bill Hurt for his acceptance in this matter, his advice, guidance and the work he has put in directly have been invaluable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-progress">Litmus Progress&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our work on converting our tests to Litmus has been ongoing with one module, MySQL having been fully converted and another, vSphere being in the process of recieving its final reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally in regards to the progress we made with Docker we are facing some challenges in regards to Windows support but we have made good progress and expect even more in the future, the changes can be seen &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/585">in this PR&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 28th Feb 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-02-28-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-02-28-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-556">ruby segfault problems in Travis discovered last week&lt;/a> now have a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems/pull/124/files">bandaid&lt;/a>, released in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#044">puppet-module-gems &lt;code>0.4.4&lt;/code>&lt;/a> - this patch ensures that concurrent-ruby &lt;code>1.1.6&lt;/code> is not installed. This has restored CI functionality for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="weekly-test-runs">Weekly Test Runs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Numerous PRs went through this week to ensure 44 modules (all those supported modules which have been converted to Litmus so far) run weekly tests via GitHub Actions.
These tests run against the master branch executing the full test suite - all of the spec tests and then all of the acceptance tests against the full matrix of operating systems for that module (defined in the &lt;code>release_checks&lt;/code> section of the &lt;code>provision.yaml&lt;/code> for that module).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These results are recorded to the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">Community Dashboard&lt;/a> in the &lt;code>Github Actions Report&lt;/code> tab, which shows the test results for the last five runs for each workflow and module.
Right now, these results are recorded fairly simply, listing the run number, the branch the tests ran against, and whether they passed or failed.
In the future, we will be improving the usefulness of this dashboard in numerous ways, but for now we just wanted a way to get some quick visualization for triage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updated-tools-pages">Updated Tools Page(s)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week we also updated the page on this site for the tools we maintain - each project header now also leads to a page for that tool with additional information.
We&amp;rsquo;ve collected some at-a-glance badges for each of the projects too.
We hope this will make keeping up with the available tooling a little easier!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-modulebuilder-gem-010-release">puppet-modulebuilder Gem 0.1.0 Release&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we mentioned last week, we&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-532">been working&lt;/a> with the PDE and Night Watch teams at Puppet on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-modulebuilder">puppet-modulebuilder&lt;/a> gem, which has now &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet-modulebuilder/versions/0.1.0">been released&lt;/a>!
This will carry the actual functionality for &lt;code>pdk build&lt;/code> and allow third-party tools to re-use the same functionality without having to pull in the whole PDK.
A new Litmus release is ongoing to take advantage of this new development!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks a lot to &lt;a href="https://github.com/glennsarti">Glenn Sarti&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/florindragos">Florin Dragos&lt;/a> for helping out with everything!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="facter-4-incoming">Facter 4 Incoming&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We started doing some prep work this week as &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter-ng">Facter&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s next major update has &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/facter/versions/4.0.8.pre">become available as prerelease&lt;/a>.
Facter 4 is a return to Ruby from C++ which allows deeper integration with the rest of our modules and test-tooling, and easier hacking on the core facts.
First we&amp;rsquo;ve got some checking and verifying to do as this major version rolls out to ensure a smooth experience for everyone.
If you want to try it out in your module&amp;rsquo;s unit tests, specify &lt;code>FACTER_GEM_VERSION='4.0.8.pre'&lt;/code> in your environment before any bundle or PDK commands.
Let us know in the &lt;a href="https://puppetcommunity.slack.com/archives/C0W1X7ZAL">#puppet-dev&lt;/a> channel on the &lt;a href="http://slack.puppet.com/">community slack&lt;/a> how it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should have more on this in the near future, particularly any advice and guidance around what it will mean for you as module developers and consumers - the expected release date is March 11th, 2020!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdk-1170-release">PDK 1.17.0 Release&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1170-2020-02-27">new release of the PDK&lt;/a> is here with initial support for control repos, system-level settings, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/compare/1.16.0...1.17.0">numerous template updates&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-puppet-blog-on-de-forking-a-module">New Puppet Blog on De-Forking a Module&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/genebean">Gene Liverman&lt;/a>, a senior SRE at Puppet, &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/blog/de-forking-a-puppet-module/">wrote a blog post on the main Puppet blog this week for de-forking a Puppet module&lt;/a> - essentially, what to do when you want to incorporate upstream changes back into a project you&amp;rsquo;ve forked.
Great work on a topic that comes up fairly often in the open source world!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve released only one module since last week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/java">puppetlabs/java&lt;/a> (v6.2.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/baurmatt">@baurmatt&lt;/a> for his change to the concat module,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-concat/pull/627">adding support for Deferred function in concat fragment&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="approved-modules">Approved Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week we happily approved two new modules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/fervid/secure_linux_cis">fervid/secure_linux_cis&lt;/a> is a CIS hardening module for Linux servers by &lt;a href="https://www.fervid.us/">fervid.us&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/stackstorm/st2">stackstorm/st2&lt;/a> installs, configures and manages the eponymous &lt;a href="https://stackstorm.com">StackStorm&lt;/a> platform for event-driven runbook automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/approved">Puppet Approved&lt;/a> modules are recommended by us for use with Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise and meet our expectations for quality and usability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-puppet-modulebuilder-gem">New puppet-modulebuilder Gem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Work &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-532">has started&lt;/a> on creating a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-modulebuilder">puppet-modulebuilder&lt;/a> gem.
This will carry the actual functionality for &lt;code>pdk build&lt;/code> and allow third-party tools to re-use the same functionality without having to pull in the whole PDK.
We expect a first release early next week.
Follow &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-552">IAC-552&lt;/a> to get a notification when that happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks a lot to &lt;a href="https://github.com/glennsarti">Glenn&lt;/a> for helping out with the actual porting of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ongoing-litmus-conversions">Ongoing Litmus Conversions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week saw a flurry of PRs (through &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdksync">pdksync&lt;/a>) to &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-215">update all our modules&lt;/a> to use the new &lt;code>use_litmus&lt;/code> support in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates">pdk-templates&lt;/a>.
This reduces the amount of configuration we need to carry in each module and validates the pdk-templates feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As expected, the last remaining modules to convert to &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">Litmus&lt;/a> were the ones we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to touch earlier for good reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-powershell/pull/283">powershell&lt;/a> has been merged and is now running acceptance tests on Windows (appveyor), Linux and OS X (travis) in public.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-sqlserver/pull/345">sqlserver&lt;/a> is still resisting,
not the least because we found several areas where the previous test suite was ignoring warnings that we now want to address.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vsphere/pull/172">vsphere&lt;/a> is progressing.
We don&amp;rsquo;t expect to enable PR-level testing on this one,
since it does require access to our internal VCenter.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in porting a module to Litmus,
feel free to reach out to us during &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/community/office-hours/">Office Hours&lt;/a> - we&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to help!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re also looking into updating litmus to make use of &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bolt-200">Bolt v2&lt;/a>.
See &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/254">puppetlabs/puppet_litmus#254&lt;/a> if you want to follow along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week also saw a number of ruby &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/jobs/653408974">segfaults&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/jobs/652904009">deadlocks&lt;/a> during acceptance testing:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="refactoring-stdlib-to-puppet4-function-api">Refactoring stdlib to Puppet4 function API&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Off the back of Ben&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://binford2k.com/2019/11/27/automagic-function-port/">blog on the Puppet4 function API&lt;/a>,
work has started to move all functions in the &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/stdlib">stdlib module&lt;/a> to the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; API.
To quote Ben:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Each modern Puppet 4.x function is just a little faster and just a little safer
to use, meaning that as we all port our functions over, compilation times across
the ecosystem will get more and more performant. Modern Puppet 4.x functions
have improved thread safety, memory management, and load time. Even more
importantly, they’re isolated to the environment they’re loaded from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And as a developer, you&amp;rsquo;ll see benefits like namespaced function signatures,
automatic data type checking, multiple dispatches allowing you to easily handle
different kinds of function invocations, and vastly improved code reuse.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of interesting things over the past week. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve released an update to two modules since last week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/pwshlib">puppetlabs/pwshlib&lt;/a> (v0.4.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/scheduled_task">puppetlabs/scheduled_task&lt;/a> (v2.0.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This update to &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/scheduled_task">puppetlabs/scheduled_task&lt;/a> resolves an issue reported in &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10101">MODULES-10101&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fix went in to &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/pwshlib">puppetlabs/pwshlib&lt;/a> to resolve a bug that was causing runtime errors on older versions of Ruby. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/ruby-pwsh/pull/30">here&lt;/a> for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll have more module releases next week, but a few interesting updates to come:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/java">puppetlabs-java&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/timdeluxe">timdeluxe&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java/pull/370">the PR&lt;/a> to add support for &lt;a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">AdoptOpen JDK&lt;/a> to the module. &lt;a href="https://github.com/fraenki">fraenki&lt;/a> was also a great help in getting this PR over the line. We&amp;rsquo;ll releasing an update to the module soon!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/mysql">puppetlabs-mysql&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/pull/1192">This is a nice PR&lt;/a> from &lt;a href="https://github.com/mauricemeyer">mauricemeyer&lt;/a> that now allows a user to override the default configuration for mysql, if you wish. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/bastelfreak">bastelfreak&lt;/a> for the help during the review stages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apt">puppetlabs-apt&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://github.com/anarcat">anarcat&lt;/a> submitted &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt/pull/904">this fix&lt;/a> which also highlighted an issue with our tests. Two for the price of one! Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/bastelfreak">bastelfreak&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/baldurmen">baldurmen&lt;/a> for the reviews, too.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="were-still-buzzing-about-honeycomb">We&amp;rsquo;re still buzzing about Honeycomb&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/iac/assets/2020-02-14-status-update/honeycomb_rspec_formatter.png" alt="Module RSpec trace">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re continuing to see the benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb&lt;/a>. To make life easier, we now have the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec_honeycomb_formatter">rspec_honeycomb_formatter&lt;/a>.
When you add this gem to a project&amp;rsquo;s Gemfile, it will create a &lt;a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/formatters/custom-formatters">Custom formatter in RSpec&lt;/a> that will capture the metrics we&amp;rsquo;re interested in, then send it to the configured Honeycomb endpoint for processing!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="supported-modules-litmus-conversion">Supported Modules Litmus Conversion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re starting to get to the bottom of the list of modules still to be converted to &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">Litmus&lt;/a>. We&amp;rsquo;re wrapping up on &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-powershell/">puppetlabs-powershell&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-sqlserver/">puppetlabs-sqlserver&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vsphere/">puppetlabs-vsphere&lt;/a>.
Converting to Litmus makes testing of the modules for both ourselves at Puppet and contributors from the Community, a much easier experience.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in porting a module to Litmus, feel free to reach out to us during &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/community/office-hours/">Office Hours&lt;/a> - we&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to help!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 7th Feb 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-02-07-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-02-07-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team have been working on a lot of interesting things these past two weeks. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="team-blog">Team Blog&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re here, you&amp;rsquo;re already aware of it - the IAC team will now be giving status updates as to what we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, any insights we&amp;rsquo;ve made and cool new tech we&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with. We&amp;rsquo;re also hoping to share more of the tools that we use internally with the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="updates-to-puppet-modules">Updates to Puppet Modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve released a number of new modules as part of our Content Triage Process.
Check out the CHANGELOG in each of the modules for more details as to what has been added:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/accounts">puppetlabs/accounts&lt;/a> (v6.1.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apache">puppetlabs/apache&lt;/a> (v5.4.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/java">puppetlabs/java&lt;/a> (v6.1.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/kubernetes">puppetlabs/kubernetes&lt;/a> (v5.1.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent">puppetlabs/puppet_agent&lt;/a> (v3.0.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent">puppetlabs/puppet_agent&lt;/a> (v3.0.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/reboot">puppetlabs/reboot&lt;/a> (v2.4.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/websphere_application_server">puppetlabs/websphere_application_server&lt;/a> (v2.0.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="kubernetes-v510">Kubernetes v5.1.0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF&lt;/a> have certified the latest version (v5.1.0) of the &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/kubernetes">puppetlabs/kubernetes&lt;/a> module with &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes&lt;/a> v1.16.6.
Check out the &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/kubernetes">module on The Forge&lt;/a> to see how to bootstrap K8 clusters and save yourself time and effort.
You may also be interested in Kubetool (bundled with the module and as a &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/puppet/kubetool">Docker image&lt;/a>) which auto-generates the Hiera security parameters, the discovery token hash, and other configurations for your Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="theres-a-buzz-about-honeycombio">There&amp;rsquo;s a buzz about Honeycomb.io&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re very excited to be in the POC stage rolling out &lt;a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb&lt;/a> to collect data from our CI / Test infrastructure.
This is going to give us much more visibility in to a number of important metrics and allow us to make the test process for modules a lot slicker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/iac/assets/2020-02-07-status-update/honeycomb_travis_appveyor.png" alt="Execution time of pdksync run on AppVeyor &amp; Travis">
&lt;strong>Execution Time of PDK Sync run on Travis and AppVeyor CI platforms&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were very excited to be working with this very cool solution and we&amp;rsquo;re already starting to get some interesting insights.
A more in depth blog post about this in the near future - don&amp;rsquo;t fly too far away!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-statistics-dashboards">Module Statistics Dashboards&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A vital part of the Content Triage Process is visibility in to the status of the modules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How many PRs are open?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the status of the last &lt;code>N&lt;/code> test results?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When was the last comment from a contributor?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There are a lot of modules on &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/supported/">The Forge&lt;/a>, so we need a way to quickly view all this data.
We have made some great improvements to our &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">Community Management&lt;/a> dashboards recently:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>More accurate reporting on module metrics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integration with &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions&lt;/a> reports / artifact to provide quicker feedback of the results from our release checks and our future nightly CI runs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
