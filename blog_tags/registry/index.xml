&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-mckinney/">Dan McKinney&lt;/a> from &lt;a href="https://cloudsmith.com/">Cloudsmith&lt;/a> has uploaded a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCmS3omimEM">cool video&lt;/a> which demonstrates how to use Puppet to deploy a package from a private &lt;a href="https://cloudsmith.com/">Cloudsmith&lt;/a> repository.
It&amp;rsquo;s great to see how Puppet can help automate ALL THE THINGS!
Great &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCmS3omimEM">video&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-mckinney/">Dan&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-7">Puppet 7&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Puppet 7 testing is ongoing. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> is kicking Puppet 7 testing off when the nightly builds are published.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="terminology-changes">Terminology changes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last week in our blog we introduced this effort and the team is continuing to work on this. With the amount of modules and tools the team looks after this is quite a large piece of work that we are dedicated to completing in a timely matter. Currently &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidswan22">David Swan&lt;/a> is continuing to work on this to get it over the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an example of one of our modules that have been revamped with the new terminology:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts">accounts&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-management-tool">Community Management Tool&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our very own &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> is working on our Community Management Tool and making it more mobile friendly. This means that soon everyone will be able to review our community reports from a mobile phone whilst on the go!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That concludes this weeks summary. As always we want to thank you all for your continuous support and understanding.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
