We worked closely with the Puppet core team on some speed improvements over the last several months. Recent work has been merged into our Ruby distribution and into Puppet core to speed up all of our applications.
Puppet VS Code extension work is coming along nicely, with all open PRs merged. We&amp;rsquo;re planning on releasing 1.3.0 May 31st&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A massive shout out to &lt;a href="https://github.com/binford2k">Ben Ford&lt;/a> for holding a group session this week and giving the team an overview of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/dropsonde">dropsonde&lt;/a> tool. We were given plenty of opportunities to ask questions and further preparation for the handover of it to the IAC Team. This is now on &lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s radar and initial scoping of work continues. For more information on exactly how this can be used check out &lt;a href="https://dev.to/binford2k/telemetry-that-doesn-t-suck-na2">Bens blog post&lt;/a>.

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="platform-7-testing-update">Platform 7 Testing Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve now have many runs of the Puppet 7 Nightly builds under our belt and the issues discovered are starting to reduce whilst our confidence is increasing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/puppetlabs/teams/night-s-watch">Night&amp;rsquo;s Watch&lt;/a> team have been fantastic in reacting to issues really promptly and going above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the fixes were delivered and verified, rapidly.
Thanks again folks and good luck as you enter the last phase of development and testing for Puppet 7!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our placement student &lt;a href="https://github.com/Disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> got her first experience of a &amp;ldquo;last minute context shift&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em>which seasoned veterans can confidently assert, won&amp;rsquo;t be the last!&lt;/em>) - thank you &lt;a href="https://github.com/Disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> for dropping your current work and jumping on with &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">myself&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> in the testing effort this week!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-ci-progress">Cloud CI Progress&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David Schmitt&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sheenaajay">Sheena&lt;/a> have continued to forge ahead on our new cloud CI solution.
A great milestone was hit this week, where the first of our &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules/">Supported Modules&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd">&lt;code>puppetlabs-motd&lt;/code>&lt;/a>) had it&amp;rsquo;s acceptance tests executed on the new platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd/pull/342/checks">Github Workflow results&lt;/a> to see how acceptance test runs using the Cloud CI platform will look.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has also prepared a demo for &lt;a href="https://digital.puppetize.com/s/landing-page4/home">Puppetize Digital&lt;/a> showing this off too - see below for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Great work team! :smiley:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="changes-to-triage-process">Changes to Triage Process&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Firstly, we&amp;rsquo;d like to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian&lt;/a> for carrying nearly all of this last triage run&amp;rsquo;s duties, himself!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are not familiar with the triage process on the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/team/basics/2020/01/29/infrastructure-automation-content-team.html">IAC Team&lt;/a>, we tend to work in 2 week blocks (running Wed - Wed).
Two team members will be responsible for a number of tasks during this time:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reviewing PRs from the Puppet Community against our &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules/">Supported Modules&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/tools/">Tools&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Assisting with code changes, testing and ultimately merging said PRs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keeping our CI ticking over&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Releasing modules and gems&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>From next week, we are going to make this an entire team effort every Monday.
We hope that with the entire team involved for a whole day, we&amp;rsquo;ll be better able to improve our engagement with the Community and move through PRs in a more responsive manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another reason is to allow us to then focus on work items the rest of the week that may have been reported by, or are towards the benefit of, the Community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s no coincidence that &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/community/office-hours/">Office Hours&lt;/a> occurs on a Monday - if you have any contributions you want to discuss via video call or on Slack, feel free to drop by - you&amp;rsquo;ll find more of the IAC Team there than ever!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="customer-reported-issues">Customer Reported Issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/pgrant87">Paddy&lt;/a> on the Support Team for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-package/pull/216">tackling and resolving an issue in the &lt;code>puppetlabs-package&lt;/code> module&lt;/a>!
(With apologies to Stephen), if you want to join the IAC Team, you know where we are, &lt;a href="https://github.com/pgrant87">Paddy&lt;/a>! :smiley:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppetize-and-demos">Puppetize and Demos&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://digital.puppetize.com/s/landing-page4/home">Puppetize Digital&lt;/a> kicks off on Nov 19th!
Our very own &lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael&lt;/a> have prepared some demos for &lt;a href="https://digital.puppetize.com/s/landing-page4/home">Puppetize&lt;/a>, and having previewed them, I know you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has put together an excellent demo (that &lt;a href="https://github.com/binford2k">Ben&lt;/a> will be delivering) that shows a PR being tested on our new Cloud CI platform.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great overview of how it&amp;rsquo;s all put together, how the Community will use it and some hints at future plans we&amp;rsquo;re excited about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael&lt;/a> has put together an equally excellent demo showing how our recently released &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc">Puppet.Dsc&lt;/a> tool which walks through a module from the PS Gallery being Puppetized in to a Puppet module!
If you&amp;rsquo;re in the Windows Sys Admin space, you will &lt;strong>NOT&lt;/strong> want to miss this!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well done &lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">Michael&lt;/a>! :clap:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s the week that was on the team!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>:jack_o_lantern: :ghost: :jack_o_lantern: :ghost: :jack_o_lantern: &lt;strong>HAPPY HALLOWEEN&lt;/strong> :jack_o_lantern: :ghost: :jack_o_lantern: :ghost: :jack_o_lantern:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 28th August 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-08-28-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-08-28-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;h2 id="team-work-dream-work">Team work, dream work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that &lt;code>simplecov&lt;/code> dropped support for Ruby 2.4 from v0.19.0 and in order to solve this problem which was first highlighted &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/issues/345">here&lt;/a>, all the team put their resources in one debug session. Step by step, we were able to understand what is happening and shortly after that, &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems">puppet-module-gems&lt;/a>(v0.5.1) was released.
Thank you &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Dani&lt;/a> for the demonstration!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/strong> &lt;code>v0.5.1&lt;/code> of &lt;code>puppet-module-gems&lt;/code> for Ruby 2.7 on Windows has not yet been uploaded to &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems&lt;/a> - we are working to get this resolved a.s.a.p.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank the fantastic Puppet Community for the following contributions over the past week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache">puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache&lt;/a>: Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/ekohl">ekohl&lt;/a> for this &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2060">fix&lt;/a> which ensures that the bool2httpd function is compatible in Ruby 2.7.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings">puppetlabs/puppet-strings&lt;/a>: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ekohl">ekohl&lt;/a> also provided this &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings/pull/246">fix&lt;/a> to ensure that we handle missing descriptions more gracefully in puppet-strings, thanks again &lt;a href="https://github.com/ekohl">ekohl&lt;/a>!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/action-litmus_spec">puppetlabs/action-litmus-spec&lt;/a>: This update to the README should hopefully make things a bit clearer for anyone else wishing to leverage the action-litmus-spec Github Action, thanks for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/action-litmus_spec/pull/38">fix&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/choffee">choffee&lt;/a>!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-docker">puppetlabs/pdk-docker&lt;/a>: Thank you &lt;a href="https://github.com/alanraison">alanraison&lt;/a> for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-docker/pull/10">fix&lt;/a> to pdk-docker which ensures openssh is now installed during container initialisation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A BIG applause for this week and the community:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ekohl">ekohl&lt;/a>: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ekohl">https://github.com/ekohl&lt;/a>

&lt;h2 id="dsc-builder-nearing-testing">DSC Builder Nearing Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lots of small issues have been closed out recently for the DSC work - paths and non enum values are now case-insensitive, DscRunAsCredential now works as expected, and the base provider lives in the &lt;code>pwshlib&lt;/code> (check the latest release) meaning you don&amp;rsquo;t have to rebuild your modules every time the base provider gets updated or improved!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tickets closed out this week represent the last technical implementation blockers for this phase of the project, everything else is documentation, testing, and user feedback! We&amp;rsquo;re nearing a launch of the PowerShell module to the &lt;a href="https://powershellgallery.com">public Gallery&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="time-for-holiday">Time for holiday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As no summer can end without a holiday, our team members Daiana and Dani will have a short PTO for recharging their batteries and prepare for a new season of fixing bugs!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That’s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 22nd May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-22-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-22-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of new things over the past week. We want to share with our community some pretty interesting things. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="daiana-has-been-made-permanent">Daiana has been made permanent!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are absolutely delighted to announce our current intern, &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a>, has recently been offered a permanent job role. Daiana has been a major influence on our community reporting tool for when we are triaging PRs and releasing modules. Some of the work Daiana has been carrying out can be viewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/22/">here&lt;/a>. We are so excited that she will be hanging around! We are all looking forward to have a celebratory beverage together at some point in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases">Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modules released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-haproxy">puppetlabs/haproxy&lt;/a> (4.2.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd">puppetlabs/motd&lt;/a> (4.1.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We absolutely love our community contributors, they are always ready to help and they have excellent ideas. Here are some highlights of this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to Trey Dockendorf for raising an issue on the latest release of the PDK, and to &lt;a href="https://github.com/scotje">Jesse Scott&lt;/a> for providing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/pull/883">fix&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has now merged this and this fix will make it out in the next release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Wiston999">Victor Cabezas&lt;/a> for a fantastic PR for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes">puppetlabs/kubernetes&lt;/a>. Its great to see such attention to detail in a PR from a community member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/andeman">andeman&lt;/a> for contributing to our &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql">puppetlabs/mysql&lt;/a> module and providing us with such a great feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to [https://github.com/vchepkov](Vadym Chepkov) for your &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/613">Docker PR&lt;/a>. Housekeeping on our modules is always beneficial and we really appreciate you taking the time to contribute.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-management-tool">Community Management Tool&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We wanted to have all the information about our supported modules in one place. We decided to change the data source of the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">Community Tool&lt;/a> from a local file called &lt;code>modules.json&lt;/code> to the online available &lt;code>https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules.json&lt;/code> which is generated from the same information that is powering the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules/">team&amp;rsquo;s modules page&lt;/a>. You can check the new updates &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/22">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The report for our tooling has been using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/12">same mechanism&lt;/a> since March. We will continue to build all our future automation tooling based on this data set, so that we can update-once-run-everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdksync-runs">PDKSync Runs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> has performed 2 PDKSync runs this week to include generic template updates in our modules and to add Ubuntu 20.04 support. &lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has been running one to switch our default provisioner from VMPooler to ABS for our weekly and pre-release CI runs. Travis was busy! &lt;code>:D&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="making-it-possible-to-visualize-data">Making it Possible to Visualize Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has &lt;del>been working hard&lt;/del> spent a few more minutes on making use of &lt;a href="https://honeycomb.io/">honeycomb&lt;/a>. This week&amp;rsquo;s new query will track our migration from VMPooler to ABS. It is super exciting that we can now see dashboards and drill down rather than scrolling through large log files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see when we started rolling out the first changes:
&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/content-and-tooling-team/assets/2020-05-22-status-update/vmpooler-abs-migration-tracker.png" alt="A graph comparing 1073 vmpooler calls with 502 ABS calls, which started around the 18th">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-image-creation">Litmus Image Creation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since the end of 2019 we&amp;rsquo;re using custom-built &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage">images&lt;/a> to test modules with &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">litmus&lt;/a>. Litmus image creation is now part of the IAC team OS certification process. As part of our work on validating all modules for Ubuntu 20.04, &lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> put in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage/pull/23/files">a quick PR&lt;/a> to add it to our list of images. Being able to easily create a new Litmus image enables the IAC to team run OS certification test across multiple modules quickly. Great Job &lt;a href="https://github.com/florindragos">Florin&lt;/a> on the Litmus image creation scripting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-iac-team-adapting-to-the-new-norm">The IAC Team Adapting to the New &amp;lsquo;Norm&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Everyone in the team seems to have started adapting to the new ‘norm’ of working from home every day. It seems everyone has started trying out new things. Here are some of the things we have been getting up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has been taking Oscar and Miku out walking almost daily, soaking up the lovely views around Belfast and of course playing &lt;a href="https://factorio.com/">factorio&lt;/a> for way too long. Can we blame him when confined to the house, lets just refer to it mastering skills online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Norman over the past year has had a lot of landscaping carried out in his garden therefore he finds himself spending more time in his garden than before. With the weather we have been having in Belfast recently he would be crazy to miss the opportunity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> now knows his neighborhood by the back of his hand, has taken up more cooking opportunities at home (he currently has enough Bolognese in his freezer to feed the whole IAC team), is getting a big nostalgia hit playing Streets of Rage 4 online with his mate and has big plans on getting back into playing guitar, it just hasn’t happened yet. Sounds like Ciaran has been doing great at keeping busy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has found himself spending more time chilling out and reading books and when he is not doing that he is ‘fine tuning’ his video gaming skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> carries out a vigorous home workout regime on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays. Way to go David, serious commitment there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sheenaajay">Sheena&lt;/a> is currently home schooling 2 lovely girls. Although when they have some down time she is exploring new recipes with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> has started to do some home workouts and has started eating healthy. I wonder if this is a result of mastering how to bake a perfect lava cake? I also wonder how shipping a lava cake would work!?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian&lt;/a> has started spending more time soaking up the surrounding views and has taken up some gardening. There is nothing more therapeutic than admiring blooming flowers at this time of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">me&lt;/a>, In my down time I have been enjoying walks, for a while I collected wild flowers, pressed them and put them into a frame to remind me of this strange time. I also spend most of my time playing with my 11 month old baby. This ranges from getting paint EVERYWHERE to letting her play in multi colored spaghetti or creating strange toys such as a rain cloud made out of cotton wool, tin foil and plastic bags.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
