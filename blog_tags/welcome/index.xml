&lt;p>The IAC team has been active over the past week.
We worked on releasing modules and also reviewing contributions from the community.
Here’s a resume of the most cool things:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases-from-iac-team">Module Releases from IAC Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve had a few modules released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes">puppetlabs/kubernetes&lt;/a> (v5.3.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank the fantastic Puppet Community for the following contributions over the past week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes">puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes&lt;/a>: Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/JasonWhall">Jason Whall&lt;/a> for this &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes/pull/436">change&lt;/a> which updates docker yumrepo default .&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts">puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts&lt;/a>: Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/jarretlavallee">Jarret Lavallee&lt;/a> for this &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts/pull/333">change&lt;/a> which allow for Sensitive type passwords in accounts::user .&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="dsc-user-testing">DSC User Testing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With the last of the major technical hurdles out of the way, the PowerShell DSC Puppetizer is ready for another wave of user testing.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/joeypiccola">Joey Piccola&lt;/a> reached out to offer some help with testing (thanks, Joey!) and we were quickly able to Puppetize and send over both ActiveDirectoryDsc and xFailOverCluster - putting almost 30 puppetized DSC resources into his hands in mere minutes!
Not only have the build times slimmed dramatically, but the packaged size of these modules is &lt;em>tiny&lt;/em>, under 150kB each!
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in participating in our beta testing program, you can reach out to us at &lt;a href="mailto:dsc@puppet.com">dsc@puppet.com&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="welcome-to-the-team">Welcome to the Team&lt;/h3>
