&lt;h2 id="new-module--gem-releases">New Module / Gem Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following modules were released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apache&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>6.4.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="devx-team-update">DevX Team Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="pdk-220">PDK 2.2.0&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>PDK 2.2.0 was released earlier in the week.
This update brings two significant new features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Support for OSX 11, Debian 11, Fedora 32 &amp;amp; 34&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ability to configure skipping validation on certain files within a project&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We have also bumped the version of Ruby the PDK is running on from 2.4 -&amp;gt; 2.5.
Please note, Ruby 2.4 is still available for testing against Puppet 5 environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also a number of bug fixes and improvements.
Full details can be found &lt;a href="https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/2.x/pdk.html">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="goodbye-james">Goodbye James&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Unfortunately we have to say goodbye to &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James&lt;/a> who is leaving Puppet next Tuesday.
No doubt, many of you will be aware of the huge amount of contributions &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James&lt;/a> has made to the Puppet ecosystem: James was the architect behind our IIS and DSC modules as well as the new autogenerated DSC modules; he touched nearly every part of Puppet that interacted with Windows across modules, Bolt, Puppet, and tooling; he co-designed and implemented the VSCode extension and language server, vastly improving the lives of everyone writing Puppet code; for the last four months he&amp;rsquo;s led this team, providing guidance and unifying our vision around what developing and maintaining Puppet content can be. Whether it be Windows content, improving the functionality and experience of Puppet&amp;rsquo;s products on Windows, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vscode">Puppet VSCode Plugin&lt;/a>, - it&amp;rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that his contributions have been many and significant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James&lt;/a> for his contributions, support and leadership and wish him the very best of luck in the next chapter of his career!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="github-changelog-generator-moved-to-puppetlabs-namespace">github-changelog-generator moved to puppetlabs namespace&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have forked &lt;code>github-changelog-generator&lt;/code> to &lt;code>puppetlabs&lt;/code> namespace .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will give more control on adding features and bug fixes which will help us with the supported module release process in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 2021-04-30: IAC &amp; DevX Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-04-30-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2021-04-30-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="community-day-triage-stats">Community Day Triage Stats&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>New this week is the Developer Experience team joining Community Day to triage new and existing tickets in the tooling repositories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The teams spring cleaning activities continues with 341 backlog issues being closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next Monday, May 3rd we will have a reduced team covering community day due to Public holidays in our EMEA region.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank the following people in the Puppet Community for their contributions over this past week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java/pull/473">&lt;code>puppetlabs-java#473&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;add url parameter for adoptopenjdk&amp;rdquo;, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/cbobinec">cbobinec&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes/pull/507">&lt;code>puppetlabs-kubernetes#507&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;Add kubeadm skip-phases option&amp;rdquo;, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/BaronMsk">BaronMsk&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes/pull/500">&lt;code>puppetlabs-kubernetes#500&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;Configure image registry settings for containerd when installed via package&amp;rdquo;, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/andeman">andeman&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="new-module--gem-releases">New Module / Gem Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following modules were released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java">&lt;code>puppetlabs-java&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>7.0.2&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-iis">&lt;code>puppetlabs-iis&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>8.0.1&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="iac-content-support-team">IAC Content Support Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> has been working on CNCF certification with Kubernetes 1.2.0, alongside this she has continued to work on additional tickets that have landed on her plate. &lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian&lt;/a> has been working on auditing a new codebase that the team plan on taking ownership of. This will be a gem/module that will help us make the most of analytics and provide us with real feedback. Last but not least [David][David Swan] has been working on porting the last of our modules to run acceptance testing using Github Actions and GCP. As these are the last few they are most definitely more complex to migrate, none the less this is a job well suited to &lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-ci">Cloud CI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are currently working on the training and education material for porting Puppetlabs modules to use the Cloud CI and a blog post about our multi-node testing. Next week we will try to prepare a troubleshooting/debug demo and a walkthrough the simplified module release process we have currently set up.
After the training and education milestone we will start focusing on improving the Puppet Developer Experience when using the Cloud CI. This will allow developers to easily provision dev environments in the cloud and use them in their development process. More news about this feature will follow in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The team is heads down on the first set of tasks to improve templates and package size identified from the PDK survey and existing tickets. As part of this work, we&amp;rsquo;re working to increase documentation on how the tool works. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> has done some wonderful work describing how the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/blob/main/reference/validate/REFERENCE.md">validation&lt;/a> system works inside the the PDK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is an upcoming Puppet VS Code Extension release with improved Puppet code tokenization implemented by &lt;a href="https://github.com/glennsarti">Glenn&lt;/a>. This enables code folding based on the language, not just the indent level, and improved code formatting speed. Look for the status in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-editor-services/pull/302">PR&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
