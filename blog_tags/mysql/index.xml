&lt;h2 id="take-it-easy-its-friday">Take it easy, it&amp;rsquo;s Friday!!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hey guys, back again with another friday update. As the end of summer starts to approach, we have been busy working on a few important updates. Firstly, as part of our latest maintenance patch, we have merged
a few important changes on the MySQL and Docker modules and released a new major version for them. Be sure to check them out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also want to take this chance to remind the community that our team is moving away from the MODULES project and, as such, any (new or old) issues or bug reports with our modules should be raised in GitHub at the
appropriate section. This helps us keep better track of our current workload and be more efficient around the issue resolution area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that, due to the bank holiday, we are not going be holding a community day on Monday 29th.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it, folks. See you next Friday and enjoy your weekend!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was an interesting week for IAC team and we have exciting news for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-7--ruby-27-certification">Puppet 7 / Ruby 2.7 Certification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are now entering the final stages of our Puppet 7 testing. With the Puppet 7 release imminent, and our Cloud CI project nearing completion, we are hoping to have Puppet 7 acceptance tests rolled out on it very soon. Before that, we are working to get unit tests running on TravisCI with Ruby 2.7.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A message from our intern:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hi all,
This week I haven&amp;rsquo;t got a lot to say&amp;hellip;. I got my first PTO in Puppet at the start of the week from Monday to Wednesday.
I returned to work on Thursday morning and started doing litmus acceptance testing on the tomcat module which was the first ticket assigned to me before going on PTO. I am delighted to have it completed!
I would also like to say thanks to my mentor Ciaran for a 1:1 session on how to do effective debugging of errors. Thanks Ciaran for such a useful session.
That&amp;rsquo;s all for this week.
Have a good weekend everyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-ci-update">Cloud CI update&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we move closer to ironing out some of the bugs we have set our targets on a couple of windows modules for the initial porting to use Cloud resources in their acceptance testing.
We have started with setting up a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-acl/pull/211">PR for puppetlabs-acl&lt;/a> and as soon as we are happy with the workflow puppetlabs-iis and registry will follow.
For a quick glance at a demo on how this setup will help in the future please take a look at &amp;ldquo;The new Puppet Developer Experience: it&amp;rsquo;s all about you&amp;rdquo; presented at the &lt;a href="https://digital.puppetize.com">Puppetize Digital 2020&lt;/a> event by Ben Ford.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thanks-to-james-pogran">Thanks to James Pogran&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpogran">James&lt;/a> from the Bolt team for helping us to resolve failing tests on &lt;a href="http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-concat">puppetlabs-concat&lt;/a> module.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/pull/1129">&lt;code>puppetlabs-stdlib#1129&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: Thank you &lt;a href="https://github.com/b4ldr">b4ldr&lt;/a> for the new types added to &lt;code>Stdlib::Ensure::File&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/pull/1128">&lt;code>puppetlabs-stdlib#1128&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: &amp;hellip;and again from &lt;a href="https://github.com/b4ldr">b4ldr&lt;/a> - this is a great addition: we now have types aligned with the IANA port category definitions, for easier comprehension.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2071">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apache#2071&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/creativefre">creativefre&lt;/a> for the fix in &lt;code>apache::mod::fcgid&lt;/code> to make it compatible on RHEL 8.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="new-module--gem-releases">New Module / Gem Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following modules were released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib">&lt;code>puppetlabs-stdlib&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>6.5.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker">&lt;code>puppetlabs-docker&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>3.12.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql">&lt;code>puppetlabs-postgresql&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>6.8.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql">&lt;code>puppetlabs-mysql&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>10.7.1&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-package">&lt;code>puppetlabs-package&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (&lt;code>1.3.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ci-improvements">CI Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As mentioned in the last week&amp;rsquo;s status update, we are currently under development of a solution that would improve the CI experience both for us as the maintainers of the modules and for everyone else in the community. One of the goals of this activity is to allow you, as the contributors, to see if any code changes affect module functionality across the supported platforms.
At the moment we depend on Travis and Docker containers to offer you a part of this experience. The solution we are working on will harness the power of different cloud providers to allow acceptance test runs on more platforms with Puppet Litmus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="life-of-an-intern-at-puppet">Life of an intern at Puppet&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As you all know already, we have our lovely new intern, &lt;a href="https://github.com/disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> who is sharing her experience with the team on the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/docs/life_of_intern.html">Life of an intern at Puppet&lt;/a> page. Please follow her blog to keep up to date with her activity here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> participated in the &lt;a href="https://everyonecancontribute.com/">#everyonecancontribute&lt;/a> podcast (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c0Vfn8BIM4">recording&lt;/a> on Wednesday where we (amongst other things) tried out the &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">gitlab&lt;/a> integration of &lt;a href="https://www.gitpod.io/">gitpod.io&lt;/a>, which provides a fully online hosted VSCode instance to code in any browser.
A lot of things just work out of the box, and we even got some of the &lt;a href="https://puppet-vscode.github.io/">Puppet VSCode extension&lt;/a> to work.

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of things over the past week.
We want to share with our community some of the most interesting things.
Here’s a brief overview of what we’ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases-from-iac-team">Module Releases from IAC Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have been busy this week with releasing the following modules:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/docker">puppetlabs/docker&lt;/a> (v3.11.0)&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A massive thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/scoopex">scoopex&lt;/a> for a number of enhancements and fixes to &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes">puppetlabs-kubernetes&lt;/a>. There are a lot of fixes and improvements incorporated in each of these PRs - for more details, take a look at the commits outlining each fix:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes/pull/418">&lt;code>puppetlabs-kubernetes#418&lt;/code>&lt;/a> resolves issues &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes/issues/365">#365&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes/issues/415">#415&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/tphoney">tphoney&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/provision/pull/126">this enhancement&lt;/a> to the ABS provision module!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shout out to Jason Stewart from our Customer Support team for liasing with &lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/MODULES-10734">MODULES-10734&lt;/a> has now been resolved and released.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="using-puppet-with-private-cloudsmith-repositories">Using Puppet with Private Cloudsmith Repositories&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-mckinney/">Dan McKinney&lt;/a> from &lt;a href="https://cloudsmith.com/">Cloudsmith&lt;/a> has uploaded a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCmS3omimEM">cool video&lt;/a> which demonstrates how to use Puppet to deploy a package from a private &lt;a href="https://cloudsmith.com/">Cloudsmith&lt;/a> repository.
It&amp;rsquo;s great to see how Puppet can help automate ALL THE THINGS!
Great &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCmS3omimEM">video&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-mckinney/">Dan&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-7">Puppet 7&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Puppet 7 testing is ongoing. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> is kicking Puppet 7 testing off when the nightly builds are published.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="terminology-changes">Terminology changes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last week in our blog we introduced this effort and the team is continuing to work on this. With the amount of modules and tools the team looks after this is quite a large piece of work that we are dedicated to completing in a timely matter. Currently &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidswan22">David Swan&lt;/a> is continuing to work on this to get it over the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an example of one of our modules that have been revamped with the new terminology:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts">accounts&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-management-tool">Community Management Tool&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our very own &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> is working on our Community Management Tool and making it more mobile friendly. This means that soon everyone will be able to review our community reports from a mobile phone whilst on the go!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That concludes this weeks summary. As always we want to thank you all for your continuous support and understanding.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 24th July 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-07-24-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-07-24-status-update/</guid><description>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Friday - time for another status update from the IAC Team!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a short overview of some of the work we and the community have been up to recently:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of great community contributions this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/fe80">fe80&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/pull/1314/">added the capability too specify by package provider and source&lt;/a>, to the &lt;a href="https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/mysql">MySQL module&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/elmobp">elmobp&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/pull/1315">fixed a bug in the MySQL module&lt;/a> which was caused by improper handling of non-printable characters being returned by MySQL.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="preparing-for-puppet-7">Preparing for Puppet 7&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Given the upcoming release of Puppet 7, the IAC team have begun working with our colleagues on the Puppet Agent team to ensure that the [supported modules]({% link modules.html %}) and [tools]({% link tools.html %}) we manage are thoroughly tested with Puppet 7.
We hope to begin testing the modules with the nightly builds of Puppet 7 from next week.
Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/mihaibuzgau">mihaibuzgau&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/gimmyxd">gimmyxd&lt;/a> for their help in this effort!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="re-engaging-with-the-dsc-builder">Re-Engaging with the DSC Builder&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;m (&lt;a href="https://github.com/michaeltlombardi">michaeltlombardi&lt;/a>) back from my paternity leave and off of CI triage, &lt;a href="https://github.com/sheenaajay">sheenaajay&lt;/a> and I are back at work on the DSC builder, racing to cross the last couple hurdles before we&amp;rsquo;re happy with the implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More on this - and possibly a full blog post on it - later, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been wrestling with canonicalizing manifest values so we can get a case insensitive &lt;em>but case preserving&lt;/em> behavior from Puppet - which is what PowerShell users expect of DSC whether or not they think about it explicitly!
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see more on the tangled web that this PR/ticket has turned into, let us know!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sheena meanwhile has been hard at work fixing bugs and ensuring that our support for class-based DSC resources is up to scratch!
She&amp;rsquo;s working on the broader end-to-end testing which should help significantly boost confidence in the capabilities of this builder.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of new things over the past week. We want to share with our community some pretty interesting things. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="daiana-has-been-made-permanent">Daiana has been made permanent!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are absolutely delighted to announce our current intern, &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a>, has recently been offered a permanent job role. Daiana has been a major influence on our community reporting tool for when we are triaging PRs and releasing modules. Some of the work Daiana has been carrying out can be viewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/22/">here&lt;/a>. We are so excited that she will be hanging around! We are all looking forward to have a celebratory beverage together at some point in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases">Module Releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modules released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-haproxy">puppetlabs/haproxy&lt;/a> (4.2.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd">puppetlabs/motd&lt;/a> (4.1.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We absolutely love our community contributors, they are always ready to help and they have excellent ideas. Here are some highlights of this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to Trey Dockendorf for raising an issue on the latest release of the PDK, and to &lt;a href="https://github.com/scotje">Jesse Scott&lt;/a> for providing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk/pull/883">fix&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has now merged this and this fix will make it out in the next release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Wiston999">Victor Cabezas&lt;/a> for a fantastic PR for &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-kubernetes">puppetlabs/kubernetes&lt;/a>. Its great to see such attention to detail in a PR from a community member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/andeman">andeman&lt;/a> for contributing to our &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql">puppetlabs/mysql&lt;/a> module and providing us with such a great feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to [https://github.com/vchepkov](Vadym Chepkov) for your &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-docker/pull/613">Docker PR&lt;/a>. Housekeeping on our modules is always beneficial and we really appreciate you taking the time to contribute.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-management-tool">Community Management Tool&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We wanted to have all the information about our supported modules in one place. We decided to change the data source of the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/community_management/">Community Tool&lt;/a> from a local file called &lt;code>modules.json&lt;/code> to the online available &lt;code>https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules.json&lt;/code> which is generated from the same information that is powering the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/modules/">team&amp;rsquo;s modules page&lt;/a>. You can check the new updates &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/22">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The report for our tooling has been using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/12">same mechanism&lt;/a> since March. We will continue to build all our future automation tooling based on this data set, so that we can update-once-run-everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pdksync-runs">PDKSync Runs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> has performed 2 PDKSync runs this week to include generic template updates in our modules and to add Ubuntu 20.04 support. &lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has been running one to switch our default provisioner from VMPooler to ABS for our weekly and pre-release CI runs. Travis was busy! &lt;code>:D&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="making-it-possible-to-visualize-data">Making it Possible to Visualize Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has &lt;del>been working hard&lt;/del> spent a few more minutes on making use of &lt;a href="https://honeycomb.io/">honeycomb&lt;/a>. This week&amp;rsquo;s new query will track our migration from VMPooler to ABS. It is super exciting that we can now see dashboards and drill down rather than scrolling through large log files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see when we started rolling out the first changes:
&lt;img src="https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/content-and-tooling-team/assets/2020-05-22-status-update/vmpooler-abs-migration-tracker.png" alt="A graph comparing 1073 vmpooler calls with 502 ABS calls, which started around the 18th">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="litmus-image-creation">Litmus Image Creation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since the end of 2019 we&amp;rsquo;re using custom-built &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage">images&lt;/a> to test modules with &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus">litmus&lt;/a>. Litmus image creation is now part of the IAC team OS certification process. As part of our work on validating all modules for Ubuntu 20.04, &lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> put in &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/litmusimage/pull/23/files">a quick PR&lt;/a> to add it to our list of images. Being able to easily create a new Litmus image enables the IAC to team run OS certification test across multiple modules quickly. Great Job &lt;a href="https://github.com/florindragos">Florin&lt;/a> on the Litmus image creation scripting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-iac-team-adapting-to-the-new-norm">The IAC Team Adapting to the New &amp;lsquo;Norm&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Everyone in the team seems to have started adapting to the new ‘norm’ of working from home every day. It seems everyone has started trying out new things. Here are some of the things we have been getting up to:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">DavidS&lt;/a> has been taking Oscar and Miku out walking almost daily, soaking up the lovely views around Belfast and of course playing &lt;a href="https://factorio.com/">factorio&lt;/a> for way too long. Can we blame him when confined to the house, lets just refer to it mastering skills online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Norman over the past year has had a lot of landscaping carried out in his garden therefore he finds himself spending more time in his garden than before. With the weather we have been having in Belfast recently he would be crazy to miss the opportunity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> now knows his neighborhood by the back of his hand, has taken up more cooking opportunities at home (he currently has enough Bolognese in his freezer to feed the whole IAC team), is getting a big nostalgia hit playing Streets of Rage 4 online with his mate and has big plans on getting back into playing guitar, it just hasn’t happened yet. Sounds like Ciaran has been doing great at keeping busy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Danny&lt;/a> has found himself spending more time chilling out and reading books and when he is not doing that he is ‘fine tuning’ his video gaming skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/david22swan">David Swan&lt;/a> carries out a vigorous home workout regime on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays. Way to go David, serious commitment there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sheenaajay">Sheena&lt;/a> is currently home schooling 2 lovely girls. Although when they have some down time she is exploring new recipes with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> has started to do some home workouts and has started eating healthy. I wonder if this is a result of mastering how to bake a perfect lava cake? I also wonder how shipping a lava cake would work!?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianiurca">Adrian&lt;/a> has started spending more time soaking up the surrounding views and has taken up some gardening. There is nothing more therapeutic than admiring blooming flowers at this time of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">me&lt;/a>, In my down time I have been enjoying walks, for a while I collected wild flowers, pressed them and put them into a frame to remind me of this strange time. I also spend most of my time playing with my 11 month old baby. This ranges from getting paint EVERYWHERE to letting her play in multi colored spaghetti or creating strange toys such as a rain cloud made out of cotton wool, tin foil and plastic bags.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 15th May 2020: IAC Team Status Update</title><link>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-15-status-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://puppetlabs.github.io/content-and-tooling-team/blog/updates/2020-05-15-status-update/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This is what she said when she was working on puppetlabs-apt release:
&lt;em>Massive shout out to Danny. I have returned from maternity leave and started working on my first release from I finished up in June 2019 and it is just like magic! The automated generation of the change log, reference documentation and tagging is just brilliant! Has definitely removed one of the biggest pain points when releasing.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;em>When my kids play up in public I like to yell &amp;ldquo;Wait until I tell your mother!&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; pretend they are not mine.&lt;/em>
Good luck, dear Michael! Enjoy this beautiful time!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Social fridays&lt;/strong>
We all know that friday is a tough day because the weekend is so close. (The legend says that friday is actually the first day of weekend, but let&amp;rsquo;s keep this secret for us). Social fridays have an incredible success for our team and today we have some special guests.
The IAC team have inviting our good friends from CIS to join our social hour this weeks.It will be great catching up with old friends.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
