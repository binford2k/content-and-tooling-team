&lt;p>Hi everybody!
Here&amp;rsquo;s an update from the IAC Team for the week that was.
It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that it has been quite an eventful week with some unexpected fires, here and there.
Nothing we and our wonderful Puppet colleagues can&amp;rsquo;t get on top of, but, worth highlighting as this week&amp;rsquo;s update may be a little light!
We&amp;rsquo;ll divulge more details in due course, after we&amp;rsquo;re on top of the fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of fires, we hope that any of our Community members and Puppet colleagues on the US West Coast are keeping safe at the moment and that life hasn&amp;rsquo;t been impacted too adversely with the wildfires coarsing through many parts of California, Washington and of course, our HQ&amp;rsquo;s home state of Oregon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay safe!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="welcome-back-david">Welcome Back David!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many of you in the Community (and of course, Puppet!) will know who &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> is - he is definitely one of the most integral members of both the Community and Puppet, interally.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> had to take some time away back in July - we mentioned this in our &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/team/status/2020/07/17/status-update.html">2020-07-17 blog post&lt;/a>.
We&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>extremely&lt;/em> happy to be able to formally welcome &lt;a href="https://github.com/DavidS">David&lt;/a> back - for the two months or so you were away, it certainly highlighted how pivotal you are to the IAC Team!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sure everyone in the wider Puppet Community are also glad to see you back too! :)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="module-releases-from-iac-team">Module Releases from IAC Team&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have two modules released this week:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-inifile">puppetlabs-inifile&lt;/a> (&lt;code>v.4.3.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp">puppetlabs-ntp&lt;/a> (&lt;code>v.8.4.0&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2063">&lt;code>puppetlabs-apache#2063&lt;/code>&lt;/a>: We&amp;rsquo;d lke to thank &lt;a href="https://github.com/nbarrientos">nbarrientos&lt;/a> for his fix that ensures the correct default shared lib path for &lt;code>mod_wsgi&lt;/code> on RHEL 8.
The responsiveness was very much appreciated by the team - a pleasure working with you!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="puppet-7--ruby-27-testing">Puppet 7 &amp;amp; Ruby 2.7 Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We continue to expand the integration testing effort of the Puppet 7 nightly builds against our core, [supported modules]({% link modules.html %}).
Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sheenaajay">Sheena&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/norman-heaney-b52bb5">Norman&lt;/a> for leading the test effort whilst I was out on vacation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dishas-second-week">Disha&amp;rsquo;s Second Week&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We didn&amp;rsquo;t scare &lt;a href="https://github.com/disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> off, by the looks of things, so we must be doing something right :)
&lt;a href="https://github.com/disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> has been working through some training material set out by the team and here&amp;rsquo;s how she&amp;rsquo;s been getting on so far, in her own words:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am currently working on the learning VM quest guide with &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/daianamezdrea">Daiana&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> to solve an issue for verifying certificates.
We hope to get this issue resolved soon so that I can continue with the learning VM training.
The link to the Quest Guide for the Puppet Learning VM is &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-quest-guide">here&lt;/a>.
I also had a quick session with &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a> to learn markdown language for writing weekly team blogs.
I will be exploring markdown language via this &lt;a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">tutorial&lt;/a> provided by &lt;a href="https://github.com/sanfrancrisko">Ciaran&lt;/a>.
There will be a dedicated training session on markdown language in the coming weeks.&lt;br>
Thank you to the team of IAC for helping me this week in the training sessions!
I am now looking forward to next week and all the exciting stuff to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Glad to have you on board &lt;a href="https://github.com/disha-maker">Disha&lt;/a> and great to see you progressing really well in such a short space of time! :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for this week from the IAC Team! Stay safe!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
